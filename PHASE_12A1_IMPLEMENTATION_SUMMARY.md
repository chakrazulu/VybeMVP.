## ðŸ§ª **How to Test the Implementation**

### **Prerequisites:**
1. Ensure you're on the `feature/location-based-astronomy` branch
2. Have Xcode open with VybeMVP project loaded
3. iPhone simulator (iPhone 16 Pro Max recommended) or physical device

### **Testing Sequence:**

#### **1. Test Sanctum Natal Chart Accordions**
```bash
# Build and run the app
1. Navigate to "My Sanctum" tab (star.circle.fill icon)
2. Scroll to the natal chart section (between Divine Triangle and Spiritual Archetype)
3. Tap each accordion header to expand/collapse:
   - "Houses (12 Life Areas)" - Should show house themes
   - "Aspects (Planetary Relationships)" - Should show aspect interpretations
   - "Glyph Map (Visual Chart)" - Should show placeholder birth chart
4. Verify smooth animations and no performance issues
5. Test scrolling with accordions open - should maintain 60fps
```

#### **2. Test Friend System Foundation**
```bash
# Test friend manager initialization
1. Open PostComposerView (from Social Timeline -> + button)
2. Check console for friend manager configuration logs
3. Look for "âœ… PostComposerView loaded data with Firebase UID" message
4. Verify no errors in friend system initialization

# Test sample data (for development)
1. In Xcode, add breakpoint in FriendManager.loadSampleData()
2. Verify sample friends and requests are loaded correctly
3. Check @Published properties update properly
```
