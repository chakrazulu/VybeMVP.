- 📱 `MandalaAssets/VybeApp/VybeMVPApp.swift` - **MOVED** main app file

## 🎯 Key Files to Examine for Next Conversation

### Priority 1: Understand New Direction
1. **`MandalaAssets/Sacred Geometry_One Line_1.svg`** - Examine the art style and requirements
2. **`MandalaAssets/VybeApp/VybeMVPApp.swift`** - Check why this was moved and what changed
3. **`MandalaAssets/VybeApp/Assets.xcassets/`** - See what assets are available

### Priority 2: Current Implementation
1. **`Views/SacredGeometryView.swift`** - Current sacred geometry implementation (may need replacement)
2. **`Views/HomeView.swift`** - Focus number display with sacred geometry
3. **`Views/RealmNumberView.swift`** - Realm number display with sacred geometry

### Priority 3: Integration Points
1. **`Core/Models/`** - Data models for focus/realm numbers
2. **`Features/`** - Various feature implementations
3. **`Managers/`** - Service managers and utilities

## 📊 Git Status
- **Current Branch:** `feature/sacred-geometry-enhancement`
- **Working Directory:** `/Users/Maniac_Magee/Documents/XcodeProjects/VybeMVP`
- **Last Major Commit:** Sacred geometry implementation with authentic patterns

## ⚠️ Critical Notes for Next Conversation

1. **File Movement:** The main app file was moved from `VybeApp/` to `MandalaAssets/VybeApp/` - need to understand why
2. **Direction Change:** User wants to replace current sacred geometry with simple SVG mandala assets
3. **Maintain Functionality:** Keep all existing features while transitioning to new visual system
4. **Asset Integration:** Determine how to integrate SVG files into SwiftUI views

## 🔄 Transition Strategy Needed

The next conversation should focus on:
1. **Understanding** the user's vision for SVG mandala integration
2. **Planning** the transition from programmatic to asset-based approach
3. **Preserving** all existing functionality during the transition
4. **Optimizing** for performance and maintainability
