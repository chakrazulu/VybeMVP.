/**
 * Represents the different mood options available for journal entries
 *
 * This enum provides a standardized set of moods that users can select when
 * creating journal entries. Each mood is represented by an emoji (raw value)
 * and has a corresponding text description.
 *
 * The enum conforms to:
 * - String: Raw values are emoji characters
 * - CaseIterable: Allows iteration over all mood options
 *
 * Usage:
 * ```
 * // Access a specific mood
 * let happyMood = JournalMood.happy
 *
 * // Get the emoji representation
 * let emoji = JournalMood.happy.rawValue  // Returns "ðŸ˜Š"
 *
 * // Get the text description
 * let description = JournalMood.happy.description  // Returns "Happy"
 *
 * // Iterate through all moods
 * for mood in JournalMood.allCases {
 *     print("\(mood.rawValue) - \(mood.description)")
 * }
 * ```
