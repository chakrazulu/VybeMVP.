## Vybe cursor rules (6/29/25)


## **Vybe Development Assistant Guidelines**

_This document outlines the comprehensive rules, standards, workflows, and protocols for the Vybe app project. It merges the legacy guidelines with new additions to guide **Cursor** (the AI development assistant) and human developers. By adhering to these rules, we ensure that Vybe’s codebase remains polished, scalable, **spiritually aligned**, and secure throughout its evolution._

### **Code Documentation & Comment Standards**

- **Update Comments with Every Change:** After **every** UI or logic change, review and update code comments immediately. This ensures comments always reflect the current behavior or design. For example, if you change a view’s dimensions or a function’s logic, adjust any comment describing it so that it remains accurate and up-to-date.

- **Maintain Existing Comment Structure:** Follow the same documentation/comment format found in well-documented parts of the codebase. If files use a particular style (such as /// for Swift documentation comments or // MARK: - Section delimiters), use that style consistently. Preserve any specific patterns, wording, or units of measure. **Baseline values in comments (like dimensions or design specs)** must be kept correct – e.g. if a comment says “**Base width: 375pt**” and you modify layout, update that number if needed. Do not remove or rewrite comments in a radically different style; instead, extend them in the established format.

- **Example – Proper Commenting Style:**

```
/// Calculates the user’s daily Realm Number based on time, location, and biometrics.
/// - Note: Uses classic digit-sum numerology; preserves master numbers (11, 22, 33, etc.).
func computeRealmNumber() -> Int { ... }
```

- In the above example, a documentation comment (///) clearly explains the method and notes the numerological rule. Always aim for this clarity in function and class headers. In implementation code, use inline // comments to clarify non-obvious logic, especially if it relates to spiritual or numerological computations.

- **Consistent Formatting:** Write comments in complete, concise sentences. Capitalize the first word and use proper punctuation. When referencing UI elements or file names in comments, use the same naming and casing as in code. This consistency makes it easier for others (and AI assistants) to follow the intent. If other files include section headers, TODO/FIXME tags, or specific indentation in comments, mirror those practices in new or edited code.

- **No Stale or Misleading Comments:** Outdated comments can be worse than no comments. Part of updating comments means removing or correcting any information that no longer applies after a change. For instance, if a comment mentions “// TODO: optimize in SwiftUI 4” and the optimization was done, either update or remove that line. Treat the comment update as an integral step of coding, not an afterthought – **code isn’t “done” until its comments are adjusted** and verified for accuracy.

### **UI & Layout Integrity Guidelines**

- **Do Not Break Existing UI Layout:** When modifying or extending the UI, ensure that you don’t inadvertently break existing components or screen layouts. Maintain the app’s current design language and structural integrity. **Never “hardcode” changes** that assume a different screen size or orientation unless intentional – all screens and components should remain responsive and behave as before (unless the task is specifically to refactor the layout). Before finalizing a UI change, test the relevant screen in multiple simulators or devices to confirm nothing essential is disrupted.

- **Preserve Baseline Dimensions:** Vybe’s UI elements often have baseline dimensions or aspect ratios defined (and sometimes documented in comments). When you adjust UI elements, keep the original design proportions in mind. For example, if a button was designed to be 44pt high to meet Apple’s tap target guidelines, avoid shrinking it below that. If you enlarge a view for new content, check siblings or containers to ensure they still align properly. Update any comment that recorded the old size to now reflect the new size, as mentioned above.

- **Maintain Visual Consistency:** Use the existing style definitions (colors, fonts, spacing) provided in the codebase or asset catalogs. **Do not introduce arbitrary new styles** without confirming they match the design ethos of Vybe. For instance, if all screens use a 16pt padding and a specific font for headers, stick to those unless directed to change. This also means following any theme or dark-mode conventions already established. Small UI tweaks can have cascading effects, so be vigilant that changing one component’s layout or class doesn’t misalign others.

- **Test Before Commit:** As part of UI integrity, always run the app on the simulator (and ideally a real device) after UI changes. Verify that dynamic content (like changing numbers, animations, or multi-line text) still renders correctly. Pay attention to edge cases: e.g., if a text field can expand, does it break the layout? If a view was scrollable, is it still reachable? Ensuring these details protects the high polish of Vybe’s interface.

### **Development Workflow & Milestone Process**

At each milestone or major checkpoint in development, follow this structured process to ensure quality and completeness:

1. **Verify Comments & Documentation:** Before considering a task “done,” confirm that all affected code comments and any related documentation files have been updated to reflect your changes. This is a **required confirmation** at each checkpoint – do not mark a feature complete until you’ve done a pass through comments (and commit messages, if needed) to sync them with the code. If working with Cursor, explicitly instruct it to review comment consistency at milestone completion.

2. **Pause for User Testing:** Once the code changes (and comments) are in place for a milestone, pause development and allow the user (or tester) to run the updated app on a personal device. This means building to an actual iPhone/iPad if possible and using the feature in a real-world scenario. The purpose is to catch any issues that aren’t obvious in the simulator and to ensure the _“feel”_ aligns with expectations. For example, if the milestone was a new animation or insight display, check that it looks and performs as intended on a device (e.g., no jank, correct colors on device screen, etc.). **Do not proceed** to further development or commit the changes until this hands-on testing is done and the user confirms everything is satisfactory.

3. **Commit and Push after Verification:** Once the user testing at that milestone is successful (i.e., the user confirms the feature works and feels right), commit your changes to the repository and push to the remote Git server. Follow any project conventions for commit messages (e.g. include the issue/ticket number, or use verbs in present tense). The commit should be done only **after** you’re confident in the code’s stability and completeness up to that point. Pushing frequently (when stable) is encouraged to avoid large divergent changes, but never push code that hasn’t been locally tested and reviewed for comment updates.

4. **Post-Push Summary & Technical Report:** After pushing the code, generate a summary of the session’s work along with a brief technical report. This can be done by Cursor or manually. The summary should concisely state **what** was accomplished in that milestone, and **why** (the purpose or problem it solves). The technical report should outline **how** it was implemented – focusing on any important technical decisions, architectural changes, or noteworthy challenges/solutions encountered. For example, if the milestone implemented a new “Realm Number” calculation algorithm, the technical report might note the use of a new Combine publisher for real-time updates, and how the algorithm maintains performance. These documents serve both as internal documentation and as a progress log for the project. Save them in the repository (or an appropriate location) for future reference.

- _Tip:_ It may be useful to maintain a running **Changelog** or session journal within the project, where each push’s summary is appended. This ensures that any team member or AI assistant coming into the project can quickly catch up on recent changes.

### **Reporting & Knowledge Transfer**

- **“Love Hertz” Summary Command:** The phrase **“love hertz”** is a special trigger in our workflow. When the user types or says _“love hertz”_ to Cursor, it signals the assistant to produce a comprehensive **Markdown summary file** (intended for sharing context in a _new_ Composer Chat or similar environment). This summary is more extensive than the regular session summary, and it should include:

    - **What the task was:** A clear description of the feature or problem tackled in the just-completed session or milestone.

    - **Why it was done:** The rationale or motivation behind the task. For example, “Users needed a way to visualize daily numerology trends, so we added a charting feature.” Explain the user story or issue that led to this work.

    - **How it’s built for scale, security, and efficiency:** An explanation of how the implementation is robust and future-proof. Note any design choices that improve scalability (e.g. using a modular architecture or background processing), security (e.g. using Keychain for sensitive data, input validation), and performance/efficiency (e.g. caching results, avoiding unnecessary recomputation). Essentially, reassure that the solution will hold up as the user base grows and does not compromise data safety or speed.

    - **Synopsis of Vybe app’s purpose, niche, and current status:** A brief re-introduction of what the Vybe app is (its core concept and niche in the market) and where the codebase/project stands at this point in time. For instance, mention that “Vybe is a spiritual wellness and social app blending numerology and AI. The codebase is in SwiftUI using MVVM, with modules for AI insights, real-time data, etc., and as of this update we have implemented X, Y, Z features…” This provides context to any new reader or AI model about the broader project.

    The **“love hertz” report** is essentially a high-level briefing document. Cursor should output it in well-formatted Markdown, ready to be copied into a new chat or shared with team members. Remember to **not include sensitive info** like API keys or user data in this summary. It’s meant to focus on design and architecture. Once generated, the user can use this to kickstart a discussion in a new context (like briefing another AI assistant or developer).

- **Session Summaries vs. Love Hertz:** Note the difference between the routine session summary/tech report (after each push) and the _“love hertz”_ comprehensive summary. The session summary is primarily for internal tracking and might be more granular or technical. The _love hertz_ summary is more narrative and holistic, useful for onboarding or high-level overviews. Both are important; ensure that Cursor or the developer produces each at the appropriate time. If the user doesn’t explicitly invoke “love hertz” but a major phase of the project has been completed, it’s good practice to suggest creating one of these comprehensive summaries for the record.

### **Spiritual & Numerological Integrity**

- **Preserve Esoteric Meanings:** Vybe is not just another app – it’s built around sacred numerology and spiritual concepts. All development must respect and preserve the **numerological and spiritual integrity** of the app’s content and features. In practice, this means that any code handling “insights”, numbers, or spiritual symbolism should not be altered in a way that changes their intended meaning. For example, if the app calculates a user’s **Focus Number** and **Realm Number** using established numerological formulas, do not modify those formulas arbitrarily. The system currently keeps special numbers (like master numbers 11, 22, 33, 44) without reducing them, per numerology practice . This rule must remain unless explicitly directed to change. Similarly, ensure that correspondences (e.g. linking numbers to chakras, planets, elements, etc.) stay correct . If a requirement arises to change such logic, double-check with the source material or product owner to confirm it still aligns with authentic traditions.

- **Accuracy in Insights:** The app provides **AI-driven insights** and interpretations based on user data and numerology. When working on features related to these insights (for instance, improving the “Explain-This-Insight” feature or tweaking how insights are displayed), maintain the _tone_ and _authenticity_ of the content. The insights should feel “mystical yet genuine,” reflecting authentic spiritual wisdom. Avoid making changes that could cause the AI to produce trivial or insensitive outputs. If updating prompt templates or fine-tuning models, ensure you incorporate the same depth of spiritual knowledge present originally. It can help to refer back to the content library (e.g. JSON templates of insights or PDFs of source material) to ensure the AI’s responses remain grounded in the intended voice.

- **No Unintended Symbol Changes:** Be cautious when altering visuals or icons that carry spiritual meaning. For instance, if there are images for chakras, tarot symbols, mandalas, etc., do not swap or modify them without considering the meaning. A color change might seem minor, but in a spiritual context it could alter the symbolism (e.g., changing the color associated with the heart chakra from green to a different color would be incorrect). Always check that any new asset or color scheme aligns with accepted spiritual correspondences.

- **Testing Spiritual Features:** Just as we test functionality, test any feature with a spiritual or numerological aspect for correctness. For example, if a new algorithm generates a daily number, verify with known numerology methods that it’s correct. If we introduce a new “angel number” detection, ensure it catches the right patterns (e.g., 111, 222) and presents them in a meaningful way. In summary, **preserve the magic of Vybe** – the numbers and insights are the core value, and our changes should reinforce, not dilute, their significance.

### **Alignment with Latest Technology (Xcode, Swift & SwiftUI)**

- **Stay Up-to-Date:** Always align the project with the **latest stable versions** of Xcode, Swift, and SwiftUI (as well as iOS, if applicable). Vybe should leverage modern language features and best practices. For example, if SwiftUI gains a new API that simplifies a custom component we wrote, we should plan to adopt it. Regularly update project settings and Swift language versions when new Xcode releases come out, testing for any deprecation warnings. This ensures longevity and that we can take advantage of improvements in performance and security.

- **Consult Official Documentation:** When uncertain about a framework usage or encountering a bug that might be due to an API change, refer to Apple’s **official documentation and guides** for the latest version, rather than relying on memory or outdated StackOverflow answers. Apple’s docs will have the most accurate and up-to-date info. For instance, if a layout behavior changes in SwiftUI, check the Developer Documentation for that view in the current SDK. By doing so, we avoid hard-coding things based on older versions. **Avoid using static version numbers** in code or comments unless necessary; instead of saying “this uses iOS 16 behavior,” prefer “uses latest SwiftUI behavior (see Apple Developer XYZ)” or simply ensure the code adapts dynamically (e.g., uses #available checks if needed).

- **Modern Swift & SwiftUI Practices:** Ensure code follows the modern conventions for Swift and SwiftUI. This includes using @State, @StateObject, @EnvironmentObject appropriately, leveraging Swift concurrency (async/await) instead of older callback patterns, and using SwiftUI’s declarative patterns (avoiding imperative UIKit hacks whenever possible). If you find any legacy code that is now suboptimal due to language evolution, note it down for future refactor (or refactor it as part of your task if feasible). The idea is to keep the codebase “fresh” so that new contributors (or AI assistants) familiar with current best practices can easily understand and extend it.

- **Maintain Compatibility:** While staying cutting-edge, also ensure that we don’t accidentally drop support for relevant environments. For example, if the app is targeting iOS 17 and above, that’s fine, but if we still support iOS 16, avoid using an API that’s only in 17 without a fallback. Adhere to the deployment target set in the Xcode project. If we bump the deployment target (say, to require a newer iOS for some feature), document that in the summary and possibly notify users if needed.

- **Tooling and CI:** Use the latest version of build tools (SwiftLint, etc., if used). If a new version of SwiftLint or a new rule comes out that would help maintain code quality, consider adopting it. The project might have a CI pipeline or at least a practice of running tests; ensure that any updates remain green on the latest Xcode. If the CI config uses a specific Xcode version image, update it in sync with our local updates.

### **AI Tools & Automation (Transpire and Future Modules)**

- **Leverage AI Assistance (Cursor & Beyond):** The Vybe project embraces AI assistants in development. **Cursor** is our on-going AI pair-programmer integrated into the workflow, but we also plan for more specialized AI tools. A notable one is **Transpire** – envisioned as a ReactBits-to-Swift translator and general automation layer for our app’s development. This means in the future, portions of a web app or React code might be translated into SwiftUI components automatically, and repetitive tasks might be handled by AI. Our development guidelines anticipate this: **write modular, clean code that an AI can easily understand and manipulate.** Favor clear structure over clever hacks, as those will translate more reliably.

- **Transpire Integration:** Transpire (an AI-powered Xcode assistant) is expected to become part of Vybe’s development ecosystem. It aims to **automate code generation and project integration** tasks. For example, Transpire might take a design or React component and output a SwiftUI view, or handle adding that new view to the Xcode project seamlessly. We should keep the codebase prepared for such automation by:

    - Defining clear interfaces and protocols (so AI-generated code can hook in with minimal coupling issues).

    - Keeping similar logic grouped (so that if an AI replaces a module, it’s less likely to break unrelated parts).

    - Using consistent naming conventions, which will help AI tools accurately place or modify code.

- **Future-Proof Architecture:** The **modular AI automation layer** of Vybe implies that in the long run we might have various AI agents handling different domains (UI generation, testing, documentation, etc.). Our architecture should be **extensible** to accommodate this. In practice, this means continuing to follow MVVM and other patterns that separate concerns. For instance, if Transpire generates SwiftUI views from React bits, those views should conform to our architecture (e.g., use existing ViewModels or services rather than introducing duplicate logic). By documenting code and maintaining consistency, we make it feasible for AI tools to plug in without human rework.

- **Acknowledging AI Limits:** While we integrate tools like Cursor and plan for Transpire, always review AI-generated code thoroughly. The rules above about not breaking the UI, maintaining spiritual integrity, etc., apply equally to AI-suggested changes. Cursor’s suggestions or Transpire’s outputs must be checked against these guidelines. If an AI suggests something that violates a rule (like a change that could alter a numerology formula), _do not blindly accept it_. Instead, adjust the prompt or fix the code manually. The AI is here to assist, but **human (or careful AI) oversight is required to uphold Vybe’s quality and ethos**.

- **Mention of Other Tools:** Transpire is one example of our forward-looking approach. We might also consider future **Xcode Source Editor Extensions**, CI bots, or other plugins to streamline development. The key is that any such tool should align with these rules. For instance, if a script auto-generates boilerplate, it should also generate the associated comments and adhere to our style. Plan and design with the mindset that parts of the development might be automated – which typically means making things deterministic and well-specified.

### **Integrating New Files into Xcode (Manual Workflow)**

When using Cursor or other AI tools to create new files (Swift files, asset catalogs, etc.), Xcode will not automatically know about these files. **You must manually integrate them into the Xcode project** to avoid build issues or duplication. Follow this step-by-step workflow whenever a new file is generated outside of Xcode’s GUI:

1. **Locate the File in Finder:** After Cursor creates a file (for example, “NewComponent.swift”), reveal it in Finder (the file system). It might be in your project directory but not yet added to the Xcode project structure.

2. **Copy the File:** In Finder, select the new file and copy it (Cmd + C or via context menu “Copy”). This places the file on your clipboard.

3. **Paste into Xcode’s Project Navigator:** In Xcode, determine the correct group/folder where this file belongs (e.g., a new view might go in the _Views_ group, a utility file in _Utilities_, etc.). Click on that destination in Xcode’s Project Navigator. Now paste the file into Xcode: either right-click and choose “Paste” (if available) or simply press Cmd + V while that group is selected. Xcode will create a new entry for the file within the project.

    - **Important:** Ensure the “**Copy items if needed**” option is checked if Xcode prompts (this will copy the file into the project’s folder if it isn’t already there). In most cases, since the file was generated in the project folder, Xcode will just reference it, but it’s good to confirm.

    - This _Paste from Clipboard_ method is crucial to avoid duplication. Drag-and-drop can also work, but copying/pasting has proven reliable in preventing Xcode from creating another duplicate file reference. The goal is one reference in Xcode to one physical file.

4. **Remove the Original (if needed):** If the file was created by Cursor in a temporary or outside location (for instance, some AIs create it on Desktop or a temp folder), delete that original so you don’t have stray copies. If the file was created in the correct project folder already, you might skip deletion – just ensure you haven’t accidentally left a file out of the project that won’t be tracked.

5. **Rename to Remove Suffix:** Often when adding a file that already exists on disk, Xcode might detect a name collision or simply append a number to the filename (e.g., you paste NewComponent.swift and end up with NewComponent 2.swift in the project). If this happens, **rename the file in Xcode** to remove the “ 2” (or “ copy”) suffix and restore the intended name. You can do this by selecting the file in Xcode and pressing Enter to edit the name. Make sure the final filename matches any references in code.

    - If Xcode added a suffix, it means there might have been another file with the same name already in the project or in the group’s folder. Double-check if that’s the case – we want to avoid duplicates. It may be that the Cursor-generated file was actually a modified version of an existing file. **Never allow two different files with the same class name** to exist; resolve any conflicts by merging changes or choosing a different name.

6. **Verify Build and References:** After adding the file, build the project to ensure Xcode sees it and there are no missing reference errors. Also open the file to confirm the content is as expected (sometimes copying from Finder ensures content, but just sanity-check). If the file is meant to be used somewhere (e.g., a new View), you might also add it to the appropriate place in code now (if the AI hasn’t already) and test that everything links up.

This manual process is admittedly a bit tedious, but it’s necessary due to how Xcode manages project files. We have scripts and future plans to automate this (**one core feature plan is an “.xcodeproj injector” script to add files seamlessly** ), but until that is in place, please follow the above steps diligently for each new file. Skipping these steps can result in missing files in the build or ghost files that cause confusion.

_(Reference: Currently, any new file created by AI must be manually added, or Xcode will not recognize it. The above workflow encapsulates those required Finder steps.)_

### **Checklist & Sprint Management System**

To keep development organized and transparent, we use a Markdown-based **checklist and task-tracking system** for each sprint/milestone. All tasks, their status, and metadata are recorded in a central file (e.g. Vybe_Sprint_Checklist.md). This system ensures both Cursor and the human team members stay on the same page regarding progress and pending work.

**Checklist Format:**

- Tasks are listed as Markdown checkboxes. Each task entry begins with a checkbox: \[ \] for incomplete tasks or \[x\] for completed tasks.

- Alongside each task, we include key metadata: **Task Name/Description**, **Owner**, **Date Assigned**, **Related Component or File**, **Sprint #**, and a **Verification Log**. The verification log is a place to note when and how the task was verified (e.g., date of testing, who verified, any commit ID or note).

**File Structure:**

We organize the checklist file by sprint or milestone. Each sprint can be a section (with a heading), under which tasks are listed. For example:

```
## Sprint 5 – New Insight Feature and UI Polish

- [ ] **Task:** Implement Chakra Alignment Animation
  **Owner:** Jane Doe
  **Date Assigned:** 2025-07-01
  **Related:** `ChakraView.swift` (UI)
  **Sprint:** 5
  **Verification Log:** _(pending testing)_

- [x] **Task:** Refactor Numerology Engine for Master Numbers
  **Owner:** John Smith
  **Date Assigned:** 2025-06-25
  **Related:** `NumerologyEngine.swift`
  **Sprint:** 5
  **Verification Log:** Tested on iPhone 12 (2025-06-28), all master numbers preserved. ✅
```

In the above example, tasks are grouped under “Sprint 5”. Each task entry provides a description and all relevant info. We use **bold** labels for the metadata to make it scannable. The second task is marked \[x\] (completed) and even includes a brief note in Verification Log that it was tested on a device and what the outcome was.

**Using the Checklist:**

- At the **start of a sprint**, define all planned tasks in the checklist file, with \[ \] (incomplete). Assign owners (who is responsible; could be a person or “Cursor” if the AI is handling it) and date. Include which part of the app it touches (so testers know where to look) and the sprint number for clarity. If tasks are added mid-sprint (due to scope change or new bug findings), add them similarly.

- Throughout the sprint, update the status. When a task is done (code completed and merged), mark it \[x\] and fill in the verification log: when it was tested and by whom. If a task spans multiple sessions or needs partial verification, you can add sub-bullets or additional notes in the log.

- Both **Cursor and the user/developers should update this file**. For instance, if Cursor completes a coding task, it can mark the task done in the checklist (and maybe note “automated test passed” in the log). If the user tests a feature on device, they should write in the log that it was verified on a certain date. This collaborative editing ensures the checklist is the single source of truth.

**Metadata Guidelines:**

- _Task Name:_ Keep it short but descriptive (“Refactor Numerology Engine for Master Numbers” rather than just “Refactor engine”).

- _Owner:_ The person or role responsible. Use real names or initials for humans, or “Cursor”/“AI” if the AI is doing it under supervision.

- _Date Assigned:_ When the task entered the pipeline – this helps track how long tasks take and provides accountability.

- _Related Component/File:_ Mention the primary file, feature, or UI screen involved. This helps quickly identify where changes occur. If multiple files, mention the most central or list a couple if needed.

- _Sprint:_ The sprint or milestone number/name. This is somewhat redundant if tasks are under a sprint heading, but including it in each task line is useful if we filter or move tasks around.

- _Verification Log:_ Start empty or with a placeholder. Once the task is done and tested, fill in notes. Include date of verification and any pertinent outcome (e.g., “All unit tests passed” or “User confirmed UX is smooth”). If a task fails verification and needs rework, note that too (e.g., “Found bug on 2025-07-02, reopened task”).

**Regular Updates:** Treat the checklist as a living document:

- Check it at the daily stand-up (or start of a coding session). Cursor can be prompted to show open tasks at any time.

- When a task is completed in code, immediately mark it and write the verification note once tested.

- At the end of a sprint, review all tasks. Any incomplete tasks should be carried over to the next sprint’s section (or explicitly moved). Completed tasks remain as historical record.

- Clean up any tasks that were added ad-hoc (sometimes AI or users might add a quick fix task; ensure it gets tracked here if not originally planned).

**Centralized Location:** Keep Vybe_Sprint_Checklist.md at the root of the project or a clearly labeled docs folder, so it’s easily accessible. This file becomes the go-to overview for project progress. New contributors or assistants can read it to see what’s done and what’s upcoming. It also doubles as a progress log for retrospectives.

By following this checklist system, we improve transparency and ensure nothing falls through the cracks. It also enforces the earlier rules: e.g., a task isn’t truly “done” until its verification is logged (which by nature means code, comments, tests, and user acceptance are all done). Cursor should respect this by not considering a job finished (even if code is merged) until the checklist reflects completion.

### **Quality Assurance and Best Practices**

- **Code Quality and Consistency:** Beyond specific rules, always aim for high-quality code. This means using meaningful naming, avoiding overly complex functions (break them down if necessary), and following SOLID principles where applicable. The codebase should remain easy to read and maintain. If you notice inconsistencies (e.g., two different patterns used in different places), flag them for refactoring to unify the approach. Consistent code is easier to debug, whether by humans or AI.

- **Performance and Scalability:** Vybe will handle real-time data (biometrics, possibly social feeds) and complex animations. Always consider the performance impact of your changes. For example, prefer efficient algorithms for number crunching (avoid unnecessary loops for the Numerology Engine if it gets called frequently), use background threads or async operations for any blocking tasks (to keep the UI smooth), and leverage SwiftUI’s efficient UI updates (minimal state updates to cause minimal re-draws). When adding new features, think about how they will scale with many users or large data sets. **Test with larger-than-normal data** (e.g., simulate a week of data for charts) to ensure the app remains responsive.

- **Security Best Practices:** User trust is paramount in a wellness app. Adhere to security best practices at all times. This includes: not logging sensitive information (e.g., don’t print raw HealthKit data or API keys), using secure storage for any personal data or keys (Keychain, as is done for API keys), and validating any input that could be malicious (though most inputs are likely user selections, still be mindful of things like not eval-ing any code or handling URLs safely). Follow Apple’s guidelines for privacy (e.g. if adding a new HealthKit field, ensure it’s covered by permissions). If dealing with networking or cloud storage (like Firestore), use secure rules and proper authentication tokens.

- **Testing and Verification:** Whenever possible, add or update **unit tests** or UI tests related to your changes. The project already has some testing in place (e.g., ContentViewModelTests.swift, etc.). If you add a new logic component (say a new calculation or service), include a test case for it, especially for edge conditions. This not only prevents regressions but also documents expected behavior. Before closing a task, run the test suite to catch any unintentional breakage. If an AI is assisting, you can ask it to suggest test cases for new features – but always review them for relevance.

- **Accessibility and Compliance:** Ensure that as you change UIs or add features, you maintain accessibility. This means keeping traits like VoiceOver labels, Dynamic Type support, and any WCAG color contrast considerations in check. For example, if you introduce a new button, set an accessibility label if the button only has an icon. Vybe’s mission is broad, and it should be usable by as many people as possible, including those using assistive technologies.

- **Continuous Improvement:** This guidelines document itself should evolve. If you encounter a scenario not covered here, or the team decides on a new standard (for example, adopting a new code formatter or deciding on a branching strategy in Git), update this cursor_rules.md file to include it. The goal is for this to remain a **single source of truth** for how we work on Vybe. New contributors or AI assistants should be able to read this and get up to speed on “how things are done here.”

By following all the above rules and protocols, we ensure a development process that honors **Vybe’s unique spirit and technical ambitions**. Every change – whether by human hands or AI assistance – should enhance the app while keeping it stable, scalable, user-friendly, and true to its mystical core. This disciplined approach will help Vybe grow into a robust, innovative platform without losing the essence that makes it special. Let this document be the compass that keeps the team (and Cursor) aligned as we continue to build and refine the Vybe experience. **Adherence is mandatory:** it guarantees that Vybe remains **polished, scale-ready, spiritually aligned, and secure** through every iteration.
