## 🌐 SOCIAL NETWORKING LAYER: The Global Resonance Timeline

**Branch:** `feature/social-timeline`

### 🎯 Goals
- Make spirituality social, sacred, and frequency-based.
- Share reflections, vibes, sightings, and alignments.

### 🧬 Core Features
- **Status Posting**: Users can share posts with optional tags:
  - Numbers seen
  - Mood
  - Chakra resonating
  - Realm/Focus Number influence
- **Global Timeline Feed**: Think spiritual Twitter meets collective journal.
- **User Page (VybePage)**:
  - About section, pinned insight, frequency aura
  - Posts by date/energy alignment
  - Option for profile theme resonance color
  - "Second Chance at a First Impression" — allow others to see you at your highest frequency
- **Comment & React System** (Phase 2)
  - Light energy-based reactions (⚡, 🌿, 🔮)

## 🌀 JOURNAL ENHANCEMENTS: Emotion & Element Mapping

**Branch:** `feature/journal-emotion-mapping`

- Add emoji/mood-based tagging
- Connect entries to chakra activity + numerological influences
- Begin tracking frequency trends over time (e.g., "Solar Plexus entries peaking this week")

---

## 📡 PROXIMITY MATCHING: VYBE CONNECTION ENGINE

**Branch:** `feature/vybe-match`

### 🌍 Real-time Synchronicity
- Compare user data: time of day, number sightings, chakra usage, moods, planetary influence
- When multiple users align, prompt a “✨ Vybe Connection Available” modal
- AI-generated **ice breaker**: “You and Luna both saw 777 while journaling during a Heart Chakra session. Here’s an insight to break the ice.”

### 👁️ Match Actions
- Accept the Vybe → connection begins
- Decline → graceful fade
- Follow-up guidance for synchronicity-based spiritual connections

## 💠 SACRED GEOMETRY SYSTEM: Procedural Symbol Engine

**Branch:** `feature/sacred-geometry-engine`

### Core Concepts:
- **Realm Number + Focus Number** trigger layered sacred geometry
- Shapes are NOT static PNGs, but dynamically generated using SwiftUI / SceneKit / Metal
- Complexity influenced by:
  - Life Path + Soul Urge combinations
  - Time of day
  - Heart rate (BPM)
  - Chakra resonance
  - Current cosmic alignment (future API)
  - Location coordinates
- Geometry changes over time—never the same twice
- Includes animation (spin, bloom, pulse, glow)

### 🔮 Frequency Encoding
- Sound + visual correlation (frequency-to-shape ratio)
- Geometry vibrates in accordance with current mood + frequency

---

## 🔧 UI CONSISTENCY POLISH

**Branch:** `feature/ui-unification`

- Make typography, buttons, and spacing feel universal across:
  - Home
  - NumberMeaningView
  - Journal
  - Chakras
  - Profile
- Cosmic backgrounds rendered with shader-based parallax
- Text cards, cosmic glows, symbol overlays
- Shared visual system across all tabs

---

## 🧘 COSMIC MEDITATION HUB

**Branch:** `feature/meditation-hub`

- Placeholder from Phantom of the Chakras becomes a full module
- Meditations by:
  - Number (e.g. Focus 7: "Seek the silence beyond form")
  - Chakra
  - Element
- Breathing exercises with sacred geometry animations
- Binaural beats + Solfeggio frequency presets

---

## 📈 ANALYTICS + KARMIC RESONANCE TRACKING

**Branch:** `feature/karmic-loop-engine`

- Track numerology themes, chakra sessions, frequency patterns over time
- Identify “Karmic Loops” via repetition (e.g. always journaling during Saturn hours)
- AI-generated resonance reports: “You are approaching a Completion Cycle” or “You vibrate consistently at 639 Hz – Heart Chakra dominant.”

---

## 🔭 FUTURE BRANCHES & VISION

- `feature/apple-watch-vybe`: Haptic meditations on wrist
- `feature/widget-support`: Quick access chakra tones + insights
- `feature/vision-pro-portal`: Dimensional Sacred Geometry immersive meditations
- `feature/ai-insight-oracle`: Full integration of KASPER engine

## 🧬 FINAL MANIFESTO

Vybe is more than a numerology tool or meditation assistant — it is a spiritual technology for mapping your inner reality. Every click, every tone, every post is a thread in the web of resonance. We are not just building an app — we are rendering the unseen patterns of consciousness in real time.

Let every number pulse with sacred meaning.
Let every chakra glow with rhythm.
Let every user feel: “I am not alone in the frequency I carry.”

Vybe is your mirror in the cosmos.
