“coreEssence”: “Six is stewardship, devotion, and beauty made usable. It longs to tend people and places, raise standards with kindness, and turn care into culture.”,

“lifeLesson”: “Serve without self-erasure. Your heart asks you to share responsibility, practice boundaries, and make systems of care that don’t rely on martyrdom.”,

“shadowSignature”: “Judgment, control disguised as helping, and burnout from over-giving. When reactive, 6 polishes for praise, keeps score, or rescues without consent. The remedy is shared ownership, humane standards, and rest that counts.”,

“physical”: { “strength”: 6, “notes”: “Grounded and hands-on; thrives with rhythmic movement, stable sleep, and tactile order.” },

“mental”: { “strength”: 7, “notes”: “Organized and standard-setting; excels at plans and checklists, needs flexibility checks to avoid rigidity.” },

“emotional”: { “strength”: 8, “notes”: “High empathy with a protector streak; benefits from clear limits and repair rituals to prevent depletion.” },

“intuitive”: { “strength”: 6, “notes”: “Reads rooms and dynamics quickly; clarity improves after solitude and nature to clear bias.” }
