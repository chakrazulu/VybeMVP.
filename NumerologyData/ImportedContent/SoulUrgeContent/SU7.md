“number”: 7,

“context”: “soulUrge”,

“coreEssence”: “Seven is contemplation, truth-seeking, and synthesis. It longs for solitude that sharpens perception, questions that refine meaning, and a life arranged around wonder and verifiable insight.”,

“lifeLesson”: “Balance inquiry with embodiment. Your heart asks you to let knowledge become practice, to pair skepticism with humility, and to share your findings so wisdom circulates.”,

“shadowSignature”: “Withdrawal, superiority of mind, and analysis paralysis. When reactive, 7 withholds warmth, nitpicks from the tower, or doubts until life passes by. The remedy is honest sharing, somatic anchors, and experiments that return data.”,

“planes”: {

“physical”: { “strength”: 5, “notes”: “Quiet stamina; benefits from walks, posture care, and sleep regularity to ground the mind.” },

“mental”: { “strength”: 8, “notes”: “Analytical, pattern-sensitive, and theory-building; needs time boxes to avoid infinite refinement.” },

“emotional”: { “strength”: 6, “notes”: “Subtle tides beneath a composed surface; intimacy grows through precise language and timed vulnerability.” },

“intuitive”: { “strength”: 8, “notes”: “Clear inner signal after silence; strongest near water, in nature, and in tech-light spaces.” }
