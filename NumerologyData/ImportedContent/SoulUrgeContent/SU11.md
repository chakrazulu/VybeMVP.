“context”: “soulUrge”,

“coreEssence”: “Eleven is illumination, intuition, and transmission. It longs to turn insight into orientation, to speak truth with lightning clarity, and to midwife breakthroughs that lift the collective.”,

“lifeLesson”: “Ground the light. Your heart asks you to stabilize a sensitive system, translate visions into steps, and pair revelation with responsibility so brilliance becomes usable.”,

“shadowSignature”: “Overwhelm, spiritual bypass, and brittle ideals. When reactive, 11 chases signs, leaks boundaries, or confuses intensity for truth. The remedy is embodiment, consent, and practice that tests the vision in real life.”,

“physical”: { “strength”: 4, “notes”: “High-voltage nervous system; needs steady sleep, minerals, and simple strength/mobility work to carry the current.” },

“mental”: { “strength”: 7, “notes”: “Pattern synthesis and meaning-making; benefits from structure and limits to avoid idea storms without output.” },

“emotional”: { “strength”: 7, “notes”: “Empathic and permeable; requires containment rituals and explicit boundaries to prevent merging or burnout.” },

“intuitive”: { “strength”: 9, “notes”: “Lightning-flash perception; clearest after silence, nature, and technology-light evenings.”
