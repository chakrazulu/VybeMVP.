      "description": "In this phase, the Moon and Sun are conjunct and in the same sign. It represents the very beginning of the planting cycleâ€”when the seed sends forth its tender shoot while still underground. This is a tentative moment with the outcome still very much in doubt. Corresponding to the Winter Solstice, the New Moon invites you to break free from existing rules and author your own: you feel empowered to question why things 'must' be done a certain way and to forge your own path in the present moment.",
      "spiritualGuidance": "Set clear intentions and focus on what you want to create in your life.",
      "ritualPrompt": "Under the dark sky, light a black or deep-blue candle at sunset. Journal: 'What intention or project am I planting now?' Write down three concrete steps you will take during this lunar cycle to nurture that seed.",

      "description": "In this phase, the Moon is waxing and halfway between New Moon and First Quarter. In the planting cycle, the young shoot must contend with a sometimes hostile environment, mirroring your own drive to actualize new forms against resistance. Corresponding to Candlemas (around February 1st), this is a time of forging ahead with fresh ideasâ€”fully invested in your purpose yet keenly aware that progress demands effort and struggle against the old status quo.",
      "spiritualGuidance": "Take concrete steps toward your goals and remain committed to your intentions.",
      "ritualPrompt": "On Candlemas eve, light a white or pale-yellow candle. Journal: 'What new impulse am I determined to bring into being?' Then stand by a window, breathe deeply, and visualize yourself breaking through any obstacle. Write down two concrete actions you will take this week to honor that purpose.",

      "description": "In this phase, the Moon is waxing and square the Sun. This represents the time in the planting cycle when the organism puts out its leaves and branchesâ€”a period of robust growth. In the cycle of the seasons, the First Quarter Moon corresponds to the Vernal Equinox, when light and dark stand in balance and new structures begin to take shape. During this phase, you are a willful builder of new frameworks for yourself and society. You characteristically exert the utmost effort to bring fresh forms into reality, even in the face of resistance. This forward push inevitably involves struggle, for the old must be confronted and reshaped before it can yield to what's new.",
      "spiritualGuidance": "Face challenges head-on and make important decisions with confidence.",
      "ritualPrompt": "On the morning of the Vernal Equinox, light a green or blue candle. Stand in a sunlit spot and journal: 'What structure or project am I committed to building this season?' Then sketch a simple blueprint or mind-map of that goal and write down three concrete actions you will take in the next week to support its growth.",

      "description": "In this phase, the Moon is waxing and halfway between First Quarter and Full Moon. This represents the moment in the planting cycle when the bud begins to form, carrying within it the promise of the flower. In the seasonal cycle, this phase is symbolically linked with the cross-quarter holiday of Beltane (around May 1st, midway between the Vernal Equinox and the Summer Solstice). During this phase, you are powerfully drawn to the accomplishment of your goals, guided by an analytical and detail-oriented mind. You have a passion for building and perfecting new forms. You will not be content with the status quo of outmoded conceptions, nor will you hesitate to move forward with necessary refinements in order to achieve true potential.",
      "spiritualGuidance": "Trust the process and make subtle adjustments to align with your highest good.",
      "ritualPrompt": "On Beltane morning, place a fresh flower in a small bowl of water and set it on your altar. Light a yellow or white candle and meditate for five minutes on what you wish to perfect in your life. Then write down one area where you can apply more attention to detail this week, and commit to taking at least one small, measurable step toward that refinement each day.",

      "keywords": ["Heightened visibility & clarity", "Strong interpersonal awareness", "Emphasis on collaboration", "Objectivity & discernment", "Potential for overexposure or vulnerability"],
      "description": "In this phase, the Moon and Sun are in opposition on opposite sides of the Earth. It corresponds to the time in the planting cycle when the flower emerges, and in the seasonal cycle it aligns with the Summer Solsticeâ€”the moment of maximum light. During the Full Moon, you become intensely aware of the effect your work and presence have on others. You operate out of visible clarity rather than blind faith, with objectivity as your guiding principle. You're open to outside influences and conscious of your own influence in turn. Your efforts feel most meaningful when shared and recognized by the community around you.",
      "spiritualGuidance": "Celebrate your achievements and release what no longer serves you.",
      "ritualPrompt": "On the night of the Full Moon, step outside and raise your arms to the sky. Invite a friend or group to join you in a circle of light. Speak aloud one intention that benefits not only you but your community. Afterward, each person takes a turn offering supportive feedback on how you might refine that intention for the greatest good.",

      "description": "In this phase, the Moon is waning and halfway between Full and Last Quarter. In the planting cycle, it corresponds to the first appearance of the plant's fruit. In the seasonal cycle, it aligns with Lammas (around August 1st), midway between the Summer Solstice and Fall Equinox. During the Disseminating Moon, your life's mission is to shed light on what you've already accomplished. You hold the knowledge of your field's fruits and are called to share that wisdom with others. As the symbolic culmination of the garden's life cycle, you represent the distribution of insight and the passing on of harvest.",
      "spiritualGuidance": "Share your knowledge and blessings with others in your community.",
      "ritualPrompt": "Under the waning gibbous light, gather a small circle. Take turns speaking one lesson you've learned this season. After each sharing, the group offers one question for deeper reflection. Conclude by collectively writing these insights on paper 'seeds' and scattering them into the wind or water, symbolizing the distribution of your knowledge.",

      "keywords": ["Letting go of outdated patterns", "Critical insight and self-reflection", "Clearing and cleansing energy", "Crisis-driven transformation", "Potential for bitterness or resistance"],
      "description": "In this phase, the Moon is waning and forms a square (90Â° apart) with the Sun. In the planting cycle, it marks the beginning of the endâ€”when the plant's fruit has been harvested and its remnants begin to wither and return to the earth, while the remaining seeds prepare for the next cycle. In the seasonal rotation, it corresponds to the Fall Equinox, when daylight and darkness are in balance and summer energies yield to autumnal decline. During the Last Quarter Moon, you embody the archetype of the dismantler and cleanser. You experience a 'crisis in consciousness' where existing structuresâ€”personal, social, or creativeâ€”feel unsustainable. This phase drives you to tear down what no longer serves, clearing the way for new beginnings. Your discontent with the status quo is a catalyst for transformation.",
      "spiritualGuidance": "Practice forgiveness and release old patterns that hold you back.",
      "ritualPrompt": "On the night of the Last Quarter Moon, write down one habit, belief, or project that you're ready to release. Safely burn or tear the paper, visualizing the old energy dissipating. Then, plant a seed or bulb in soilâ€”symbolizing your commitment to new growth emerging from the cleared ground.",

      "description": "In this phase, the Moon is waning and lies between the Last Quarter and New Moon. In the planting cycle, it represents the final maturation of the seed while the plant itself dies backâ€”concentrating all its life force into the seed that will birth the next cycle. Seasonally, it aligns with Halloween (Samhain), midway between the Fall Equinox and Winter Solstice, when the veil between worlds is thin. During the Balsamic Moon, you embody the archetype of the mystic-messenger. You feel grounded in a distant, almost hidden reality, and you may sense alienation from mainstream structures. Like the dying plant, you distill wisdom from past experiences to prepare the way for something entirely newâ€”though the form of that future remains unseen. You're called to strike out on your own, shed the last remnants of the old, and broadcast your insights as a herald for the coming dawn.",
      "spiritualGuidance": "Take time for self-care and inner reflection before the next new moon.",
      "ritualPrompt": "During the Balsamic Moon, spend time in quiet ritual. Write a letter to your future self, describing the wisdom you've gleaned from the past cycle. Seal it and set it aside in a safe place. Then meditate on releasing any lingering attachmentsâ€”visualizing them dissolving into the darkâ€”so that when the New Moon arrives, you can open the letter and step fully into the new chapter.",

      "description": "The Void of Course Moon occurs when the Moon has completed its final major aspect to any other planet and driftsâ€”'void'â€”until it moves into the next sign. During this interval, the course of events often feels unpredictable: plans stall, decisions prove difficult, and arrangements can shift unexpectedly. Traditional astrologers avoid launching new projects, signing contracts, or making major commitments under a void Moon, choosing instead to wait for a fresh lunar ingress.",
      "spiritualGuidance": "Embrace the pause and use this time for inner reflection and gentle practices.",
      "ritualPrompt": "When you notice the Moon is void of course, pause all new undertakings. Instead, engage in gentle practicesâ€”journaling your thoughts, meditating, or performing divination. Treat this as a time to clear mental clutter: write down any lingering concerns, then set the page aside or safely discard it. When the Moon enters the next sign, you'll emerge with a clearer mind and renewed focus for action.",
