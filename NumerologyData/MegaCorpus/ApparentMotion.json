      "name": "Direct Motion",
      "glyph": "ü°í",
      "symbol": "Forward Flow",
      "definition": "The standard‚Äî'forward'‚Äîapparent movement of a planet through the zodiac. The Sun and Moon are always in direct motion; the other planets alternate between direct and retrograde.",
      "energy": "Progressive Momentum",
      "keywords": ["Clear outward expression", "Steady progress and momentum", "Favorable for action, initiation, and implementation", "Energies unfold predictably in time", "Supports decision-making and forward planning"],
      "description": "Direct Motion represents the natural, unhindered flow of planetary energy. When a planet is in direct, its themes and functions move outward in a clear, progressive manner: intentions set now are likely to unfold smoothly and visibly in the world. This phase supports forward momentum, steady growth, and the outward expression of the planet's qualities.",
      "ritualPrompt": "When you observe a planet in direct motion, harness its forward-driving energy. Choose a goal you wish to advance‚Äîwhether a project, relationship, or personal habit‚Äîand craft a simple action plan with concrete steps. Then light a white candle or incense as you state your intention aloud: 'With the planet's forward flow, I move boldly toward my aim.' Carry a small token or write your intention on paper, and revisit it whenever momentum stalls."

    "stationedRetrograde": {
      "name": "Stationed Retrograde",
      "glyph": "‚Ñû‚è∏",
      "symbol": "Power Pivot",
      "definition": "A planet reaches its retrograde station when it appears to come to a standstill before reversing direction. At this moment, its energy is especially potent‚Äîheld in stasis and lingering in any aspect it occupies, with conjunctions especially intensified. Outer planets yield the strongest station energies.",
      "energy": "Intensified Threshold",
      "keywords": ["Intensified planetary themes", "Suspension of outward progress", "Heightened awareness of the planet's lesson", "Ideal for deep reflection and review", "Energies held in stasis before directional shift"],
      "description": "Stationed Retrograde marks a threshold between forward motion and inward reflection. The planet's themes are amplified and suspended, offering a unique pause in which its full potency can be felt. This station invites deep review of the planet's lessons, a moment to recalibrate before the backward‚Äîor 'retrograde'‚Äîjourney begins.",
      "ritualPrompt": "When you note a planet stationed retrograde, honor its pause by creating a sacred space for introspection. Write down questions you've been carrying related to that planet's domain. Light a dark-colored candle to symbolize the stillness and speak your questions aloud. Sit quietly and listen for inner guidance. Close by snuffing the candle‚Äînever blow it out‚Äîas a gesture of reverence for the planet's potent pause."

    "retrogradeMotion": {
      "name": "Retrograde Motion",
      "glyph": "‚Ñû",
      "symbol": "Backward Loop",
      "definition": "A planet moves backward ('retrogrades') through the Zodiac in its geocentric path as seen from Earth. Personal planets retrograde briefly every 1‚Äì2 years; outer planets retrograde for months each year.",
      "energy": "Inward Review",
      "keywords": ["Inner-directed energy & introspection", "Delays, misunderstandings, or breakdowns in the planet's domain", "Best used for review, research, and tying up loose ends", "Not ideal for launching new projects in that planetary sphere", "Heightened awareness of past patterns & lessons"],
      "description": "Retrograde Motion marks a period of reversal and interiorization. The planet's themes turn inward, inviting review, correction, and deeper understanding rather than forward action. It's a cosmic 'rewind,' where past decisions and patterns come into focus for refinement before the next forward push.",
      "ritualPrompt": "When you observe a planet retrograde, pause new initiatives in its domain and set aside time for guided reflection. Choose a journal or voice memo. Focus your questions on: What needs revisiting? What lessons have I overlooked? Light a pale-colored candle to honor the clearing process. As it burns, calmly review past choices related to that planet. Extinguish the candle by covering it, symbolizing the integration of insights before moving forward."

    "stationedDirect": {
      "name": "Stationed Direct",
      "glyph": "‚ö°",
      "symbol": "Forward Loop",
      "definition": "A planet reaches its direct station when it begins to move forwards once again after retrograde. Outer planets' direct stations are especially powerful.",
      "energy": "Breakthrough Clarity",
      "keywords": ["Sudden clarity & renewed momentum", "Breakthroughs in areas stalled during retrograde", "Ideal for launching or re-launching projects", "Strengthened aspects remain in orb longer", "Energies feel expansive and outwardly directed"],
      "description": "Stationed Direct signals the turning point from inward review back into forward action. It's a 'go' moment‚Äîstructures align, clarity returns, and the planet's themes can finally manifest outwardly after a period of introspection.",
      "ritualPrompt": "When you notice a planet stationed direct, ignite a bright candle (white or gold) at the exact moment of station. Write down a single clear intention that you want to move forward with, then speak it aloud three times. As the candle burns, envision tangible steps unfolding. When the candle reaches halfway, take your first concrete action toward that goal, symbolizing the planet's forward motion."

    "retrogradeShadow": {
      "name": "Retrograde Shadow",
      "glyph": "‚Ü∂",
      "symbol": "Dotted Backward Arrow",
      "definition": "Retrograde Shadow refers to the degrees a planet traverses while moving backward; the planet remains under retrograde influence until it re-crosses the degree at which it first turned retrograde.",
      "energy": "Final Integration",
      "keywords": ["Lingering themes from the retrograde cycle", "Degree-specific introspection and fine-tuning", "Continued subtle delays or miscommunications", "Ideal for tying up loose ends rather than new launches", "Invites conscious release of outdated patterns"],
      "description": "When a planet is in its retrograde shadow, the lessons of its retrograde phase still echo. It's a final sorting-out period: patterns triggered during retrograde may linger until the shadow is fully left behind. Only then can you step cleanly into forward motion.",
      "ritualPrompt": "When a planet finally leaves its retrograde shadow, look up the exact degree and sign where its retrograde began. At sunset that day, write that degree on a slip of paper. Hold it gently over a small flame (safely), visualize the old patterns burning away, then speak aloud: 'I release what no longer serves so I may move forward.' Bury the ashes or scatter them outside to seal the closure."
