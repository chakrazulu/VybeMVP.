      "description": "The conjunction‚Äîor 0 degrees‚Äîimplies that the planets, whether transiting or natal, occupy approximately the same position in the chart. This is considered the strongest blend of energies represented by the two planets. At its core, the Conjunction archetype is the Forge: where two distinct vibrations merge into a single, amplified force. It intensifies focus and personal power, creating synergy when aligned, but can also spotlight blind spots when similar energies collide without distinction.",

The Opposition archetype is the Axis‚Äîdrawn taut between two extremes, it compels you to find balance by facing what you project onto others.",
