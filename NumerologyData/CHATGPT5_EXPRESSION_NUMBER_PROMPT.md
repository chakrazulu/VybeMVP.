## **MISSION CRITICAL SPIRITUAL AI PROJECT**

- Reduced to single digit or master number (11, 22, 33, 44)

### **Expression vs Life Path vs Soul Urge:**

- **Soul Urge (Vowels in Name):** Inner desires, what motivates you
- **Expression (Full Name):** How you manifest in world, your natural talents

### **Integration Principles:**
- Expression colors how Life Path lessons are learned and communicated

- Harmony between all three creates authentic self-expression
- Master numbers indicate teaching/healing gifts
