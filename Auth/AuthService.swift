/*
 * ========================================
 * üîê AUTH SERVICE - SECURE LOGOUT MANAGEMENT
 * ========================================
 * 
 * CORE PURPOSE:
 * Centralized authentication service handling secure user logout process.
 * Manages Firebase Cloud Messaging token deletion, keychain cleanup, and
 * user state reset. Ensures complete data removal and notification cleanup.
 * 
 * LOGOUT PROCESS SEQUENCE:
 * 1. FCM Token Deletion: Removes Firebase Cloud Messaging token to stop notifications
 * 2. Keychain Cleanup: Removes user credentials and sensitive data
 * 3. UserDefaults Reset: Clears onboarding status and user preferences
 * 4. State Management: Updates SignInViewModel to trigger UI navigation
 * 
 * SECURITY FEATURES:
 * - FCM Token Deletion: Prevents continued push notifications after logout
 * - Keychain Cleanup: Removes all stored user credentials
 * - UserDefaults Reset: Clears user-specific onboarding flags
 * - Complete State Reset: Ensures no user data remains in app state
 * 
 * INTEGRATION POINTS:
 * - Firebase Messaging: FCM token management for notifications
 * - KeychainHelper: Secure credential storage and deletion
 * - UserDefaults: User preference and onboarding status storage
 * - SignInViewModel: UI state management and navigation control
 * - AuthenticationManager: Global authentication state coordination
 * 
 * ERROR HANDLING:
 * - FCM Token Errors: Graceful handling of token deletion failures
 * - Keychain Errors: Secure cleanup even if some operations fail
 * - State Reset: Ensures UI navigation regardless of cleanup success
 * - Logging: Comprehensive error tracking for debugging
 * 
 * PERFORMANCE NOTES:
 * - Asynchronous Operations: FCM operations run in background
 * - Parallel Processing: Keychain and UserDefaults cleanup can run simultaneously
 * - UI Responsiveness: State updates on main thread for smooth navigation
 * - Memory Management: Proper cleanup prevents memory leaks
 * 
 * USAGE:
 * Called during user logout to ensure complete data removal and
 * prevent any residual user data or notifications from persisting.
