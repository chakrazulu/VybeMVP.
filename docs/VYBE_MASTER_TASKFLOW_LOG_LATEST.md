## 🔧 **TECHNICAL FIXES COMPLETED**

### **1. SwissEphemerisCalculator.swift**
```swift
// BEFORE: Heliocentric coordinates (incorrect for astrology)
let mercuryEcliptic = mercury.heliocentricEclipticCoordinates

// AFTER: Geocentric coordinates (correct for astrology) 
let mercuryEquatorial = mercury.equatorialCoordinates
return convertEquatorialToEclipticLongitude(...)
```

### **2. NatalChartSection.swift - Data Conversion**
```swift
// BEFORE: Data loss causing 0.0° display
degree: Int(swissPosition.degreeInSign)

// AFTER: Proper rounding preserves accuracy
degree: Int(swissPosition.degreeInSign.rounded())
```

### **3. Accordion Animation Fix**
```swift
// BEFORE: Complex transitions causing glitches
.transition(.asymmetric(
    insertion: .opacity.combined(with: .move(edge: .top)),
    removal: .opacity.combined(with: .move(edge: .top))
))

// AFTER: Simple, smooth transitions
.transition(.opacity)
```
