## 📋 **TEST SCENARIOS**

### **Scenario 1: Baseline Cosmic Animation Performance**
**Duration:** 2 minutes
**Steps:**
1. Launch app → Navigate to "Test Cosmic Animations"
2. Scroll up/down for 30 seconds continuously
3. Tap test buttons while scrolling
4. Let animations run idle for 30 seconds
5. Record: FPS, CPU%, Memory MB

**Expected Results:**
- **FPS:** Consistent 60fps
- **CPU:** < 10% average
- **Memory:** < 80MB stable

### **Scenario 2: HomeView Cosmic Integration**
**Duration:** 3 minutes
**Steps:**
1. Navigate to "🌌 Main App"
2. Scroll through HomeView content for 45 seconds
3. Long-press sacred geometry (cosmic picker)
4. Change focus number multiple times
5. Scroll during number transitions
6. Record: FPS during scroll, Memory growth

**Expected Results:**
- **FPS:** 60fps maintained during scroll
- **CPU:** < 15% during animations
- **Memory:** No growth during number changes

### **Scenario 3: Cosmic Match Detection Stress Test**
**Duration:** 5 minutes
**Steps:**
1. Navigate to HomeView
2. Manually trigger cosmic match (if possible)
3. Observe match overlay performance
4. Scroll during match celebration
5. Test multiple match scenarios
6. Record: Match overlay FPS, Animation smoothness

**Expected Results:**
- **Match Overlay:** Smooth 60fps celebration
- **Background Animations:** Continue during match
- **Memory:** No leaks after match completion

### **Scenario 4: Extended Usage Performance**
**Duration:** 10 minutes
**Steps:**
1. Use app normally for 10 minutes
2. Navigate between cosmic views
3. Trigger multiple animations
4. Monitor memory growth over time
5. Check for performance degradation

**Expected Results:**
- **Memory:** Stable, no continuous growth
- **Performance:** No degradation over time
- **Animations:** Consistent throughout session
