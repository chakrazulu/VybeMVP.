**Ruling Planets:** Aries→Mars · Leo→Sun · Sagittarius→Jupiter

**Sign Order Numbers:** 1 (Aries), 5 (Leo), 9 (Sagittarius)

> Fire radiates outward energy—enthusiastic, excitable, and relentlessly optimistic. It seeks to illuminate the unknown, to kindle vision into reality. Fire signs are fiercely independent: honest to a fault, impatient for action, and freedom-loving. They thrive on grand ideals and bold expression, trusting intuition over caution.

**Key Traits**

- **Energetic Drive:** Always “on,” forging ahead into new territory

- **Creative Will:** Sparks ideas into being, loves bold gestures

**Ruling Planets:** Taurus→Venus · Virgo→Mercury · Capricorn→Saturn

Earth people are practical nurturers: detail-oriented, reliable, and self-sufficient. They can be stubborn in their methods yet deeply generous in support.

> Air carries the breath of ideas—adaptive, curious, and socially attuned. It links realms of thought, weaving conversation and connection. Air people live in the mind’s currents: quick to learn, delighting in debate, yet sometimes detached from emotion. They dream collective futures into being with logic and vision.

Water people remember every nuance of feeling: compassionate, creative, yet prone to overwhelm if ungrounded. They offer a mirror to the soul’s hidden depths.

**Key Traits**

- **Emotional Resonance:** Feels collective moods with uncanny sensitivity

- **Healing Presence:** Provides comfort and transformation through empathy

## Styling & Integration Tips


- **Colors:** Fire = Crimson | Earth = Emerald | Air = Azure | Water = Sapphire

- **Modes:** Cardinal = Gold | Fixed = Copper | Mutable = Silver

- **Drop-in Points:** Use these as detail pages in your “Learn” tab, or pipeline into KASPER for daily insight generation.

    - Use **Sign-Order Numbers** both in UI (e.g. “♈︎ 1st House”) and in your numerology engine to link Focus/Realm numbers.

    - Feed the **Resonant Numbers** arrays into KASPER to tailor prompts by numerology.

    - Color-code each element/mode as before to reinforce energetic signatures.

## Export-Friendly Structure

The Milanote board you shared is **very clear** and **well-structured**—you’ve captured every layer (polarity, Jungian tie, archetype, rulers, numbers, traits, signs, prompts) in a consistent, scannable way . A few thoughts on how you might tighten it even further:

1. **Visual Hierarchy**

    - **Group Related Fields** into boxed cards (e.g. all “Key Traits” under a tinted background) so a glance tells the eye “this is the trait block.”

    - **Pull-out Numbers**: put the “Sign Order Numbers” and “Resonant Focus Numbers” side by side in a small grid or table to make the numeric links pop.

2. **Consistent Bulleting & Line Breaks**

    - Some entries (e.g. “Ruling Planets”) wrap mid-line, which can interrupt scanning. Consider listing each planet on its own line or comma-separating consistently.

3. **Icons & Color Cues**

    - If Milanote supports emojis or custom icons, add the element glyph (🔥, 🌍, 🌬️, 🌊) next to the header and use that same color tone (Crimson, Emerald, Azure, Sapphire) to border each card.

    - For modes, you could use a tiny gold/​copper/​silver dot beside the title to reinforce the metal-tone mapping.

4. **Interactive “Drill-Down” Notes**

    - Under each “Vybe Ritual Prompt,” leave a faint placeholder icon or link where you’ll drop in the exact journaling or voice-note action—this primes you to hand it off to KASPER content.

5. **Export-Friendly Structure**

    - When you later convert to Markdown or JSON for your content repo, each section can mirror this outline:

```
Fire:
  polarity: Masculine/Yang
  jungian: Intuition
  archetype: Pioneer’s Spark
  rulers: [Mars, Sun, Jupiter]
  sign_numbers: [1,5,9]
  traits:
    - Energetic Drive
    - Creative Will
    - Passionate Courage
  ritual_prompt: "Write down one bold intention …"
```

1.

    -

    - That way, the Milanote layout directly informs your data model.

Overall, this format is **highly effective** for mapping out every field you need—these tweaks will make it even more **developer- and designer-friendly** when you export into your app’s content pipeline. Let me know which area you’d like to refine next!

**How to use**

- **Drop into** your content service (e.g. load from JSON on-device)

- **Feed** the resonantFocusNumbers and resonantRealmNumbers arrays directly into KASPER prompts

- **Render** each section in SwiftUI detail views, mapping glyph → SF Symbols / emojis and signOrderNumbers → house labels

Let me know if you’d like any tweaks—additional fields (chakra links? season correspondences?) or a YAML variant!
