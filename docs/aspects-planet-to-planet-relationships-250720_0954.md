# Aspects (planet-to-planet relationships)

## Aspects

Here’s the full transcription of the slide:

**ASPECTS**

When the relative positions of two planets in the horoscope form a significant angle with each other, they are said to be in aspect with one another. The type and quality of the aspect is determined by the number of degrees between the two planets and is only considered significant if it is within a narrow range of degrees, or orb. A list of the aspects used in the application is given below.

- **Conjunction** 0° ± 8°

- **Opposition** 180° ± 8°

- **Trine** 120° ± 8°

- **Square** 90° ± 6°

- **Sextile** 60° ± 4°

- **Inconjunct** 150° ± 2°

- **Quintile** 72° ± 2°

- **Semi-sextile** 30° ± 2°

- **Semi-square** 45° ± 2°

- **Sesquiquadrate** 135° ± 2°

- **Bi-quintile** 144° ± 1°

- **Septile** 51.4286° ± 1°

Let me know which aspect you’d like to dive into first, and I’ll craft it in our standard outline — starting with numerology (angle/orb), glyph, archetype, key traits, ritual prompt, and JSON.

## ☌ Conjunction


### **☌ Conjunction**

**🔢 Aspect Parameters**

- **Angle:** 0°

- **Orb:** ±8°

**🔸 Glyph & Symbol**

- **Glyph:** ☌

- **Symbol:** Overlapping Circles

**🔸 Archetype & Description**

The conjunction—or 0 degrees—implies that the planets, whether transiting or natal, occupy approximately the same position in the chart. This is considered the strongest blend of energies represented by the two planets. At its core, the Conjunction archetype is the Forge: where two distinct vibrations merge into a single, amplified force. It intensifies focus and personal power, creating synergy when aligned, but can also spotlight blind spots when similar energies collide without distinction.

**🔸 Key Traits**

- Synergy & Integration

- Intensified Focus & Will

- Fusion of Gifts & Challenges

- Breakthrough Initiation

- Potential for Overwhelm if Unbalanced

**🔸 Ritual Prompt**

“Light a white candle at dawn and journal: ‘Which two areas of my life feel most intertwined right now?’ Reflect on how their energies can support each other, then set a conscious intention to honor both without losing individual clarity.”
