## 🔧 **Technical Implementation Areas**

### **Data Encryption**
```swift
// Future Implementation Examples
// Keychain storage for sensitive spiritual data
let keychainManager = KeychainManager()
keychainManager.storeSecurely(key: "user_health_data", value: encryptedData)

// End-to-end encryption for spiritual health insights
let encryptionService = E2EEncryptionService()
let encryptedInsight = encryptionService.encrypt(spiritualHealthData)
```

### **Audit Logging**
```swift
// Future audit trail implementation
struct AuditLogger {
    func logPHIAccess(userId: String, dataType: String, action: String) {
        // Log all access to protected health information
    }
}
```

### **User Consent Management**
```swift
// Future consent management system
struct ConsentManager {
    func requestHealthDataConsent() -> Bool
    func trackConsentChanges(userId: String, consentType: ConsentType)
    func revokeConsent(userId: String, dataType: String)
}
```
