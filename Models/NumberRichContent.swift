//  PURPOSE:
//  Flexible, forward-compatible decoding model for rich number content
//  from the KASPERMLXRuntimeBundle. Matches actual behavioral insight schema
//  with spiritual categories, intensity scoring, and persona-based content.
//
//  SCHEMA EVOLUTION STORY:
//  - v1.0: Simple overview/symbolism/correspondences/practices structure
//  - v2.1.5: Rich behavioral insights with intensity scoring and persona guides
//  - Current: Supports both schemas for backward compatibility
//
//  DATA SOURCE: KASPERMLXRuntimeBundle/RichNumberMeanings/{number}_rich.json
//  CONTENT: 20+ behavioral insights per number with 70-90% intensity scoring
//
