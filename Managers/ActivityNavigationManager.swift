/*
 * ========================================
 * ðŸ§­ ACTIVITY NAVIGATION MANAGER - DEEP LINKING SYSTEM
 * ========================================
 *
 * CORE PURPOSE:
 * Manages deep linking and navigation between different app sections, particularly
 * for directing users to specific insights in the Activity tab or Realm tab.
 * Provides centralized navigation state management for cross-tab communication.
 *
 * TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE:
 * - Singleton pattern for app-wide access
 * - ObservableObject for SwiftUI state management
 * - Published properties for reactive navigation triggers
 * - Cross-tab communication via shared state
 *
 * NAVIGATION FLOWS:
 * 1. Insight Deep Linking: Navigate to specific insight in Activity tab
 * 2. Realm Tab Navigation: Switch to Realm tab for number analysis
 * 3. State Reset: Clean up navigation state after successful navigation
 *
 * INTEGRATION POINTS:
 * - ContentView: Main tab controller that responds to navigation requests
 * - ActivityView: Displays specific insights when navigated to
 * - RealmNumberView: Target for realm-specific navigation
 * - AIInsightManager: Triggers insight navigation requests
 *
 * STATE MANAGEMENT:
 * - insightToView: Specific insight to display in Activity tab
 * - navigateToActivityTab: Boolean trigger for tab switching
 * - navigateToRealmTab: Boolean trigger for realm tab navigation
 *
 * USAGE PATTERNS:
 * - Called by AIInsightManager when new insights are generated
 * - ContentView observes navigation triggers and switches tabs
 * - ActivityView reads insightToView to highlight specific content
 * - State is reset after successful navigation to prevent race conditions
