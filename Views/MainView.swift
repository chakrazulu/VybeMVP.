/*
 * ========================================
 * üè† MAIN VIEW - SIMPLIFIED FOCUS NUMBER DISPLAY
 * ========================================
 *
 * CORE PURPOSE:
 * Simple view component for displaying the current focus number from FocusNumberManager.
 * Serves as a basic test interface and demonstration of reactive state management.
 *
 * TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE:
 * - @EnvironmentObject: FocusNumberManager for reactive focus number updates
 * - VStack Layout: Simple vertical stack with title and optional controls
 * - Reactive Updates: Automatically updates when focus number changes
 *
 * INTEGRATION POINTS:
 * - FocusNumberManager: Source of truth for focus number state
 * - ContentView: Can be embedded in main app navigation
 * - TestingView: Used for focus number testing and validation
 *
 * USAGE:
 * - Development testing of focus number updates
 * - Simple focus number display without complex UI
 * - Demonstration of reactive SwiftUI state management
 *
 * DEPRECATED FEATURES:
 * - Restart Timer button: Removed as FocusNumberManager updates reactively
 * - Manual timer control: No longer needed with automatic updates
