## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### Initial Setup (One-time)

```bash
# Setup complete self-healing development environment
make self-healing-setup

# This will:
# ✅ Install Python dependencies and pre-commit hooks
# ✅ Install SwiftLint with runtime quality rules
# ✅ Configure pre-push hooks for both Python and Swift
# ✅ Validate RuntimeBundle integrity
# ✅ Generate initial content coverage report
```

### Daily Development Workflow

```bash
# Before starting development - validate system health
make self-healing-validate

# During development - quick content check
make content-lint

# Before pushing - comprehensive validation (automatic via hooks)
git push origin feature-branch
# This triggers:
# - Content linting validation
# - SwiftLint quality gates  
# - RuntimeBundle validation
```

### Content Coverage Monitoring

```bash
# Generate coverage report (console output)
make coverage-report

# Generate detailed markdown report
python scripts/generate_content_coverage_report.py --format=markdown --output=coverage.md

# JSON format for CI integration
python scripts/generate_content_coverage_report.py --format=json
```

## 🔧 Component Details

### 1. Pre-push SwiftLint Quality Gates

**File:** `.swiftlint.yml`  
**Purpose:** Prevent runtime code quality issues from reaching repository

#### Self-Healing Rules Implemented

- **Swift 6 Concurrency Safety**
  - `no_weak_self_in_views`: Prevents `[weak self]` in SwiftUI Views (structs)
  - `mainactor_ui_updates`: Enforces `await MainActor.run {}` over DispatchQueue.main.async
  - Actor safety and isolation rules

- **Memory Safety & Runtime Stability**
  - `no_force_unwrap_production`: Blocks force unwraps (security hardening)
  - `weak_delegate`: Prevents retain cycles
  - `task_weak_self_classes`: Ensures [weak self] in Task blocks

- **VybeOS-Specific Rules**
  - `kasper_router_singleton`: Enforces KASPERContentRouter.shared usage
  - `valid_spiritual_numbers`: Validates spiritual number ranges (1-9, 11, 22, 33, 44)

#### Hook Integration

Pre-push hook automatically runs SwiftLint with `--strict` mode, blocking pushes on violations:

```yaml
-   id: vybe-swiftlint-pre-push
    entry: swiftlint --strict --quiet
    stages: [push]
```

### 2. Fail-fast Behavioral Regression Tests

**File:** `VybeMVPTests/RuntimeBundleFallbackRegressionTests.swift`  
**Purpose:** Verify RuntimeBundle fallback chain (rich → behavioral → template) under all conditions

#### Test Coverage Areas

- **Core Fallback Chain** - Complete path validation for all numbers/contexts
- **Master Number Behavior** - Special handling for 11, 22, 33, 44
- **Error Resilience** - Missing manifest, corrupted content handling
- **Concurrent Access** - Thread safety under load
- **Performance Validation** - Fallback speed requirements (<50ms)
- **Memory Stability** - No leaks during repeated fallbacks
- **Diagnostic Accuracy** - Monitoring system integrity

#### Key Test Methods

```swift
func testCompleteFallbackChain() // Core functionality
func testMasterNumberFallbackBehavior() // Spiritual significance
func testConcurrentFallbackAccess() // Thread safety
func testSelfHealingIntegrationEndToEnd() // Complete system test
```

### 3. Content Coverage CI Reporting

**File:** `scripts/generate_content_coverage_report.py`  
**Purpose:** Complete visibility into missing rich/behavioral content

#### Report Features

- **Coverage Statistics** - Overall, rich content, and behavioral content percentages
- **Priority-based Missing File Identification** - Master numbers get highest priority
- **Gap Analysis** - Which numbers/contexts need attention
- **CI Integration** - Automatic PR comments with coverage reports
- **Multiple Output Formats** - Console, JSON, and Markdown

#### Priority Scoring Algorithm

```python
# Master numbers: +100 priority
# Sacred numbers (7): +50 priority  
# Base numbers (1-9): +30 priority
# Missing rich content: +40 priority
# Missing behavioral contexts: +20 each
# Complete misses: +100 bonus
```

#### CI Integration

GitHub Actions automatically:
- Generates coverage reports on every PR
- Posts detailed markdown comments
- Fails builds when coverage drops below thresholds
- Tracks coverage trends over time

### 4. Runtime Bundle Validation

**File:** `scripts/validate_runtime_bundle.py`  
**Purpose:** Pre-push validation of RuntimeBundle integrity

#### Validation Areas

- **Manifest Integrity** - Version consistency, required fields
- **File Existence** - All referenced content files present
- **JSON Schema Validation** - Content structure correctness
- **Fallback Strategy Validation** - Supported fallback modes
- **Master Number Coverage** - Critical spiritual numbers validated
