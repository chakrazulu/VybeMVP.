## üé® **UI Consistency and Stability**

### **Apple Human Interface Guidelines Compliance**
- **Follow Apple HIG** for consistent UI elements (button placement, gestures, etc.)
- **Reuse existing styles** rather than creating new variants (colors, typography, components)
- **Test on iPhone 16 Pro Max simulator** (and other relevant devices) to catch layout issues
- **Ensure smooth animations** without jitter or abrupt transitions

### **Vybe-Specific UI Standards**
- **Sacred Color System:** Use documented color mappings (0-9 number correspondences)
- **Animation Standards:** 2-3s pulse effects, 0.3s transitions, 6s celebrations
- **Spiritual Integrity:** Preserve numerological correspondences and mystical meanings
- **Performance Target:** Maintain 60fps during all interactions

### **Layout and Responsiveness**
- **Test on target devices:** Default to iPhone 16 Pro Max simulator
- **Avoid layout breaks:** Ensure UI works across different screen sizes
- **Smooth transitions:** No unstable or jarring animations
- **Accessibility:** Support Dynamic Type and VoiceOver

## üìù **Code Comments and Documentation**

### **Claude Comment Standards**
- **Prefix all AI-added comments** with `// Claude:` for easy identification
- **Use Swift documentation style** (`///`) for public declarations and complex logic
- **Explain the "why"** not just the "what" in comments
- **Keep comments concise** and relevant

### **Documentation Requirements**
- **Public declarations:** Each function, class, or property should have doc comments
- **Complex logic:** Document non-obvious algorithms, especially spiritual calculations
- **Update comments:** Remove outdated comments when code changes
- **Self-documenting code:** Use clear, descriptive naming conventions

### **Spiritual Content Documentation**
- **Numerological integrity:** Document any spiritual correspondences or calculations
- **Sacred systems:** Explain chakra mappings, color meanings, and mystical logic
- **Preservation notes:** Mark areas where spiritual authenticity must be maintained

---

## üìÅ **File Creation and Project Structure**

### **Organization Standards**
- **Follow MVVM structure:** Models, Views, ViewModels in appropriate folders
- **Logical grouping:** Group by feature or architectural layer
- **Clear naming:** Files named after their primary class/struct (e.g., `MyView.swift` for `struct MyView`)
- **Avoid deep hierarchies:** Keep file paths shallow and manageable

### **File Management Protocol**
- **Manual Xcode Integration:** After creating Swift files, manually add them to Xcode project
- **Place files appropriately:** Views in Views folder, Models in Models folder, etc.
- **Follow existing conventions:** Match the project's current structure
- **Document new components:** Add header comments explaining purpose and usage during sprint reviews

### **Manual Xcode File Addition Process**
When Claude Code or Cursor creates new Swift files:

1. **Create/Edit files** in filesystem using Claude Code or Cursor
2. **Open Xcode** and navigate to Project Navigator
3. **Right-click on appropriate group** (Views, Features, Managers, etc.)
4. **Select "Add Files to 'VybeMVP'..."**
5. **Navigate to the file location** and select the new .swift file(s)
6. **Choose options:**
   - ‚úÖ **"Add to target: VybeMVP"** (checked)
   - ‚úÖ **"Create groups"** (selected)
   - ‚ùå **"Copy items if needed"** (unchecked - files already in correct location)
7. **Click "Add"** to complete integration

**Note:** Automated sync tools are in development (see PastelyPrototype/) but currently require manual addition for safety

### **Vybe Project Structure**

## Build & Test Process
- **NEVER commit code without user confirmation**
- User must test on real device before any git commits
- Only commit after user explicitly confirms the build works
- Always run build/lint commands before suggesting commits

## Code Quality
- Always check imports when using UI functions (e.g., SwiftUI for withAnimation)
- Maintain existing code style and patterns
- Test thoroughly before marking tasks complete

## Memory
- **Build Testing:** I will test the builds myself unless just syntax checking because it will time out everytime.
