# 🧪 Phase 12A.1 Testing Guide
**Quick Testing Instructions for Sanctum Enhancements & Social Graph**

## 🚀 **Quick Start Testing**

### **1. Build and Run**
```bash
# Open Xcode
# Select iPhone 16 Pro Max simulator (recommended)
# Build and run (⌘+R)
```

### **2. Test Sanctum Natal Chart Accordions**
```
🎯 Navigate: "My Sanctum" tab (star.circle.fill icon)
📍 Location: Between "Divine Triangle" and "Spiritual Archetype" sections
✅ Expected: Three accordion sections with expand/collapse functionality

Test Steps:
1. Scroll to natal chart section
2. Tap "Houses (12 Life Areas)" → Should expand/collapse smoothly
3. Tap "Aspects (Planetary Relationships)" → Should show aspect descriptions
4. Tap "Glyph Map (Visual Chart)" → Should show birth chart placeholder
5. Test multiple accordions open simultaneously
6. Verify smooth scrolling performance with accordions expanded
```

### **3. Test @Mention System in Post Composer**
```
🎯 Navigate: Social Timeline tab → + button → PostComposerView
📍 Location: Content section header and text field
✅ Expected: Mention button and typing detection functionality

Test Steps:
1. Look for "Mention" button in content section (should be disabled initially)
2. Type "@" in content field → Should trigger mention detection
3. Tap manual "Mention" button → Should open friend picker sheet
4. Verify "No friends to mention" empty state shows
5. Test typing "@test" → Should detect mention attempt
6. Check console for FriendManager initialization logs
```

### **4. Test Friend System Infrastructure**
```
🎯 Monitor: Xcode console output during app usage
📍 Location: Background services and data management
✅ Expected: Clean initialization without errors

Console Messages to Look For:
✅ "✅ PostComposerView loaded data with Firebase UID: [userID]"
✅ "🔄 Friend requests updated: 0 incoming, 0 outgoing"
✅ "🔄 Friendships updated: 0 active friendships"
❌ No error messages or crashes related to FriendManager
```

### **5. Verify Data Files**
```
🎯 Check: Cosmic data processing completion
📍 Location: Project docs folder
✅ Expected: Structured JSON file with astrological data

File to Verify:
📁 /docs/phase_12x_cosmic_data.json
- File size: ~50KB+ (comprehensive data)
- Valid JSON format
- Contains: elements, modes, houses, signs, aspects, planets, numerology
- AI integration config section present
```

## ⚠️ **Expected Behaviors (Not Bugs)**

### **Normal Limitations:**
- **Mention button disabled** → No friends exist for new users (expected)
- **Empty friend picker** → Sample data not loaded in production mode
- **Placeholder natal chart** → Real Swiss Ephemeris integration pending
- **Console logging** → Development mode shows detailed system activity

### **Performance Expectations:**
- **Smooth scrolling** in Sanctum with accordions open
- **Responsive mention typing** detection without lag
- **Quick sheet animations** for mention picker
- **No app crashes** or memory warnings

---

## 🐛 **What to Report as Issues**

### **Immediate Concerns:**
❌ App crashes when opening Sanctum or Post Composer
❌ Accordions don't expand/collapse or cause layout issues
❌ Mention system causes typing lag or text field problems
❌ Console shows error messages related to friend system
❌ Significant performance degradation in any app area

### **Visual Issues:**
❌ Accordions overlap other content or break layout
❌ Mention picker sheet doesn't present properly
❌ Text rendering issues in mention system
❌ Color theming inconsistencies with cosmic design

---

## 📊 **Success Indicators**

✅ **Sanctum**: Accordions expand/collapse smoothly with no crashes
✅ **Social**: Mention button appears and friend picker opens
✅ **Console**: Clean initialization messages without errors
✅ **Performance**: App feels responsive with no significant slowdowns

## 🔧 **Developer Testing Commands**

### **Enable Sample Data (Optional)**
```swift
// Add this in PostComposerView.onAppear for testing UI:
// friendManager.loadSampleData()
```

### **Console Commands to Monitor**
```bash
# Filter Xcode console for Phase 12A.1 activity:
- Search for "Phase 12A.1"
- Search for "FriendManager"
- Search for "natal chart"
- Look for "mention" related logs
```

### **Test with Different Users**
```bash
# To test friend system properly:
1. Create multiple test accounts
2. Send friend requests between accounts
3. Test mention system with real friendships
4. Verify bidirectional data sync
```
