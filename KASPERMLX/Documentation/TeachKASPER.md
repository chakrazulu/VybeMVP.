## 🧠 **KASPER MLX Training Pipeline**

### **Phase 1: Data Ingestion**
```swift
// Claude: Data pipeline for massive insight ingestion
class KASPERTrainingDataManager {
    /// Ingests thousands of spiritual insights from JSON files
    func ingestTrainingCorpus(from jsonFiles: [URL]) async throws -> TrainingCorpus {
        // Process Grok 4 generated content
        // Validate insight quality and authenticity
        // Structure for Apple MLX training
    }
    
    /// Validates spiritual authenticity and technical quality
    func validateInsightQuality(_ insight: SpiritualInsight) -> ValidationResult {
        // Check numerological accuracy
        // Verify astrological correspondences  
        // Ensure spiritual depth and authenticity
    }
}
```

### **Phase 2: Apple MLX Model Integration**
```swift
// Claude: Replace template system with true AI inference
extension KASPERMLXEngine {
    /// Generate insights using trained Apple MLX model
    func generateMLXInsight(
        for number: Int,
        category: InsightCategory,
        context: SpiritualContext
    ) async throws -> KASPERInsight {
        // Use trained MLX model for inference
        // Apply numerological and astrological context
        // Return personalized spiritual guidance
    }
}
```

### **Phase 3: Continuous Learning**
```swift
// Claude: Learn from user feedback to improve insights
class KASPERLearningEngine {
    /// Update model based on positive/negative feedback
    func incorporateFeedback(_ feedback: UserFeedback) async {
        // Adjust insight generation based on user responses
