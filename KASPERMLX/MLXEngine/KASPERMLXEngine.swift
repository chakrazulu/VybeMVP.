    /// that understands the user's unique spiritual journey and current state.
    ///
    /// 🌍 INTEGRATION ARCHITECTURE:
    ///
    /// The configuration creates a comprehensive spiritual data ecosystem:
    ///
    /// 1. PERSONAL SPIRITUAL CONTEXT:
    ///    - RealmNumberManager: User's spiritual environment and growth patterns
    ///    - FocusNumberManager: Current spiritual intentions and manifestation goals
    ///    - Provides consistent spiritual identity across all guidance requests
    ///
    /// 2. BIOMETRIC SPIRITUAL ALIGNMENT:
    ///    - HealthKitManager: Heart rate variability, wellness data, meditation readiness
    ///    - Enables spiritual-physical harmony guidance and optimal timing recommendations
    ///    - Respects user privacy - only accesses data with explicit permission
    ///
    /// 3. PROVIDER ECOSYSTEM:
    ///    - CosmicDataProvider: Real-time planetary positions and astrological events
    ///    - NumerologyDataProvider: Integrated with user's personal spiritual numbers
    ///    - BiometricDataProvider: Connected to user's wellness and readiness data
    ///    - MegaCorpusDataProvider: Rich spiritual wisdom database access
    ///
    /// ⚙️ CONFIGURATION PROCESS:
    ///
    /// 1. Manager registration and weak reference establishment
    /// 2. Provider initialization with manager integration
    /// 3. MLX model initialization (or template fallback activation)
    /// 4. System readiness validation and status updates
    /// 5. Logging and diagnostic setup for quality tracking
    ///
    /// 🛡️ GRACEFUL DEGRADATION:
    ///
    /// The engine handles missing managers elegantly:
    /// - nil managers don't prevent system operation
    /// - Cosmic data remains available for universal spiritual guidance

    /// - Faster insight generation through provider pre-loading
    /// - Reduced memory usage through manager weak references
    /// - Enhanced personalization through integrated spiritual context

    ///
    /// 1. CACHE AVAILABILITY:
    ///    - Searches for existing valid cached insights for the feature
    ///    - Considers cache expiry times and spiritual freshness requirements
    ///    - Fast path: If valid cached insight exists, availability is immediate
    ///
    /// 2. PROVIDER READINESS:

    ///    - Cosmic providers: Can current planetary data be calculated?
    ///    - Numerology providers: Are user's spiritual numbers accessible?
    ///    - Biometric providers: Is wellness data available if needed?
    ///    - MegaCorpus providers: Is spiritual wisdom database accessible?

    /// 3. SYSTEM CAPACITY:
    ///    - Checks current engine load and processing capacity
    ///    - Considers active inference count against concurrency limits
    ///    - Evaluates system memory and performance health
    ///
    /// 🌟 INTELLIGENT DECISION MAKING:
    ///
    /// The availability check enables smart UI behavior:
    /// - Enable spiritual guidance buttons only when insights can be delivered quickly
    /// - Show loading states vs disabled states based on availability assessment
    /// - Provide helpful user feedback about why spiritual guidance might be delayed
    /// - Allow progressive enhancement where basic guidance loads while better context loads
    ///
    /// 🚀 PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION:
    ///

    /// - Cache lookup: O(1) hash table access for instant results
    /// - Provider queries: Async parallel execution for minimal latency
    /// - Early exit: Returns immediately when cache hit is found
    /// - Lightweight: No actual spiritual processing, only readiness assessment
