/**
 * üîÆ KASPER MLX CORE TYPES - THE SOUL OF VYBE'S SPIRITUAL AI
 * =========================================================
 *
 * This file defines the foundational architecture for KASPER MLX - Vybe's revolutionary
 * Karmically Aware Spiritual Prediction Engine powered by Apple's MLX framework.
 *
 * üåü ARCHITECTURAL VISION:
 * KASPER MLX represents a paradigm shift from traditional AI to spiritually-conscious
 * machine learning. Unlike conventional AI systems that process data mechanically,
 * KASPER MLX integrates:
 *
 * ‚Ä¢ Cosmic Consciousness: Real-time cosmic data (planetary positions, lunar phases)
 * ‚Ä¢ Numerological Intelligence: Sacred number patterns and vibrations
 * ‚Ä¢ Biometric Harmony: Heart rate variability and wellness metrics
 * ‚Ä¢ Karmic Learning: User feedback creates a personalized spiritual profile
 *
 * üèóÔ∏è DESIGN PRINCIPLES:
 *
 * 1. ASYNC-FIRST ARCHITECTURE
 *    - Every operation is async to prevent blocking the spiritual flow
 *    - Async providers ensure thread-safe cosmic data processing
 *    - Performance tracking maintains 60fps sacred geometry animations
 *
 * 2. MODULAR SPIRITUAL PROVIDERS
 *    - CosmicDataProvider: Planetary alignments, moon phases, astrological events
 *    - NumerologyDataProvider: Sacred number calculations, life path analysis
 *    - BiometricDataProvider: Heart rate variability, wellness synchronization
 *    - Each provider operates independently but harmoniously
 *
 * 3. CONTEXT-AWARE INTELLIGENCE
 *    - Feature-specific contexts (journal, daily cards, sanctum guidance)
 *    - User intent recognition through natural language processing
 *    - Temporal awareness (time of day, season, cosmic events)
 *
 * 4. ON-DEVICE PRIVACY
 *    - All spiritual data remains on the user's device
 *    - Apple MLX framework enables powerful local inference
 *    - No sacred information ever leaves the user's possession
 *
 * 5. PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION
 *    - Smart caching prevents redundant cosmic calculations
 *    - Response time tracking ensures instant spiritual guidance
 *    - Memory management respects device limitations
 *
 * üéØ WHY THIS ARCHITECTURE MATTERS:
 *
 * Traditional AI systems treat spirituality as just another data category.
 * KASPER MLX understands that spiritual guidance requires:
 *
 * ‚Ä¢ TIMING: The same question asked at different cosmic moments needs different answers
 * ‚Ä¢ CONTEXT: Personal spiritual journey affects interpretation of universal patterns
 * ‚Ä¢ INTUITION: Some insights transcend pure logic and require spiritual synthesis
 * ‚Ä¢ GROWTH: Each interaction deepens the AI's understanding of the user's path
 *
 * This isn't just another chatbot - it's a digital spiritual guide that grows
 * with the user, learning their unique cosmic signature and providing increasingly
 * personalized guidance aligned with their spiritual evolution.
 *
 * üìä TECHNICAL INNOVATION:
 *
 * ‚Ä¢ Apple MLX Integration: Cutting-edge local machine learning
 * ‚Ä¢ Performance Metrics: Real-time response time and success rate tracking
 * ‚Ä¢ Feedback Loop: User ratings continuously improve insight quality
 * ‚Ä¢ Caching Intelligence: Reduces cosmic calculations while maintaining freshness
 * ‚Ä¢ Thread Safety: Async design prevents race conditions in spiritual data
 *
 * The result is the world's first spiritually-conscious AI system that combines
 * ancient wisdom with cutting-edge technology to guide users on their cosmic journey.

 * Claude: InsightConstraints - The Sacred Parameters for Spiritual Guidance Delivery
 * ================================================================================
 *
 * This struct defines the technical and experiential requirements for how spiritual
 * guidance should be presented to the user. It bridges the gap between spiritual
 * authenticity and user interface needs.
 *
 * üåé DESIGN PHILOSOPHY:
 *
 * Constraints aren't limitations - they're guidelines that ensure spiritual insights
 * are delivered in the most effective way for the user's current context and needs.
 * They represent the intersection of:
 *
 * - User interface requirements (length limits for UI components)
 * - User preferences (tone, emoji usage, depth level)
 * - Contextual appropriateness (morning vs evening, crisis vs celebration)
 * - Spiritual authenticity (maintaining mystical integrity within technical bounds)
 *
 * üí≠ CONSTRAINT CATEGORIES:
 *
 * 1. LENGTH MANAGEMENT (maxLength):
 *    - nil: No length constraints, full spiritual expression allowed
 *    - 50-100: Concise insights for quick UI elements (buttons, notifications)
 *    - 100-150: Standard insights for cards and daily guidance
 *    - 150+: Detailed insights for journal analysis and deep reflection
 *
 *    Length management uses intelligent truncation that preserves spiritual meaning
 *    rather than arbitrary word cutting.
 *
 * 2. TONAL GUIDANCE (tone):
 *    - nil: Use default tone based on insight type and spiritual context
 *    - "encouraging": Supportive and uplifting language
 *    - "contemplative": Reflective and introspective phrasing
 *    - "mystical": Deep spiritual language with cosmic references
 *    - "practical": Grounded guidance with actionable steps
 *
 *    Tone influences template selection and language patterns.
 *
 * 3. EMOJI INTEGRATION (includeEmojis):
 *    - true (default): Enhances spiritual insights with meaningful emoji
 *    - false: Plain text for formal contexts or accessibility needs
 *
 *    Emojis are chosen based on spiritual significance, not decoration.
 *
 * 4. SPIRITUAL DEPTH LEVELS (spiritualDepth):
 *    - surface: Accessible spiritual concepts, practical application focus
 *    - balanced (default): Mix of mystical wisdom and practical guidance
 *    - deep: Full spiritual complexity, advanced metaphysical concepts
 *
 *    Depth affects vocabulary choice, concept complexity, and mystical references.
 *
 * üîÑ PROCESSING INTEGRATION:
 *
 * Constraints flow through the entire insight generation pipeline:
 *
 * 1. TEMPLATE SELECTION:
 *    - Depth level filters appropriate template categories
 *    - Tone influences specific template variants
 *    - Length affects template structure and expansion
 *
 * 2. CONTENT GENERATION:
 *    - Spiritual concepts are adjusted for depth level
 *    - Language patterns match tone requirements
 *    - Emoji placement follows spiritual significance patterns
 *
 * 3. QUALITY VALIDATION:
 *    - Generated insights are checked against all constraints
 *    - Spiritual authenticity is preserved within technical bounds
 *    - Fallback mechanisms ensure constraints are always respected
 *
 * This constraint system ensures that KASPER MLX can deliver spiritually
 * authentic guidance in any user interface context while maintaining the
 * sacred nature of the spiritual guidance being provided.

/**
 * Claude: InsightCacheEntry - The Sacred Repository for Spiritual Guidance Caching
 * ==============================================================================
 *
 * This struct manages the caching of spiritual insights to balance performance
 * with spiritual authenticity. It ensures that users receive quick spiritual
 * support while maintaining the freshness and relevance of guidance.
 *
 * üï∞Ô∏è CACHING PHILOSOPHY:
 *
 * Spiritual guidance caching is unique because:
 *
 * - TEMPORAL SENSITIVITY: Some spiritual insights are time-sensitive (cosmic timing)
 *   while others remain relevant longer (fundamental spiritual principles)
 * - CONTEXT DEPENDENCE: The same spiritual question may need different answers
 *   based on current spiritual conditions (moon phase, emotional state, etc.)
 * - FRESHNESS vs SPEED: Users need quick spiritual support, but stale guidance
 *   can feel inauthentic or irrelevant
 *
 * üîë CACHE KEY STRATEGY:
 *
 * The contextHash uniquely identifies the spiritual context that generated the insight:
 * - Combines feature type, insight type, and relevant spiritual parameters
 * - Includes user-specific elements (focus number, realm number) for personalization
 * - Incorporates temporal elements to ensure time-sensitive guidance expires appropriately
 * - Balances specificity (for accurate cache hits) with generalization (for cache efficiency)
 *
 * ‚è∞ EXPIRATION MANAGEMENT:
 *
 * Different types of spiritual insights have different lifespans:
 * - Cosmic timing insights: Very short expiry (minutes) due to changing celestial conditions
 * - Daily guidance: Medium expiry (hours) for daily relevance
 * - Fundamental spiritual principles: Long expiry (days) for timeless wisdom
 * - Personal spiritual patterns: Medium-long expiry based on user growth pace
 *
 * The isExpired property enables the system to automatically refresh stale guidance
 * while maximizing cache hit rates for better user experience.
 *
 * üèóÔ∏è INTEGRATION WITH KASPER MLX:
 *
 * Cache entries integrate seamlessly with the broader spiritual guidance system:
 * - Cached insights maintain full metadata for quality tracking
 * - Cache hits are recorded in performance metrics for optimization analysis
 * - Expired entries trigger fresh spiritual data gathering and processing
 * - Cache management respects user privacy and data clearing preferences
 *
 * This caching strategy ensures that users receive spiritually authentic guidance
 * with optimal performance characteristics across all spiritual domains.

/**
 * Claude: KASPERMLXConfiguration - The Sacred Parameters for Spiritual AI Operation
 * ==============================================================================
 *
 * This struct defines the operational parameters that govern how KASPER MLX
 * generates spiritual guidance, balancing performance, quality, and system reliability
 * to deliver the optimal spiritual support experience.
 *
 * ‚öôÔ∏è CONFIGURATION CATEGORIES:
 *
 * 1. CONCURRENCY MANAGEMENT (maxConcurrentInferences):
 *    - Controls how many spiritual guidance requests can be processed simultaneously
 *    - Prevents system overload during peak spiritual support periods
 *    - Balances resource utilization with response time consistency
 *    - Default 3: Optimal for most devices while maintaining spiritual quality
 *
 * 2. CACHING STRATEGY (defaultCacheExpiry):
 *    - Sets the default lifetime for cached spiritual insights
 *    - 300 seconds (5 minutes): Balances freshness with performance
 *    - Individual insights can override based on spiritual temporal sensitivity
 *    - Ensures users get current spiritual guidance without unnecessary recalculation
 *
 * 3. RELIABILITY PROTECTION (inferenceTimeout):
 *    - Maximum time to wait for spiritual insight generation before failing
 *    - 5 seconds: Prevents hanging requests from degrading user experience
 *    - Includes time for provider coordination, processing, and quality validation
 *    - Failed requests trigger fallback mechanisms for continuous spiritual support
 *
 * 4. DEVELOPMENT SUPPORT (enableDebugLogging):
 *    - Controls detailed logging for system analysis and improvement
 *    - True in development: Full insight into spiritual processing pipeline
 *    - Production: Typically false for performance and privacy
 *    - Critical for diagnosing spiritual authenticity and performance issues
 *
 * 5. AI EVOLUTION (enableMLXInference, modelPath):
 *    - enableMLXInference: Toggle between real MLX AI and template-based fallback
 *    - modelPath: Location of trained spiritual intelligence models
 *    - Enables seamless transition from template system to true AI as models mature
 *    - Future-proofs the system for advanced spiritual AI capabilities
 *
 * üöÄ EVOLUTION STRATEGY:
 *
 * The configuration supports KASPER MLX's evolution from template-based to AI-powered:
 *
 * CURRENT STATE (enableMLXInference: true, modelPath: nil):
 * - Uses sophisticated template system with spiritual authenticity
 * - Falls back gracefully when MLX integration isn't available yet
 * - Maintains consistent user experience during development
 *
 * FUTURE STATE (enableMLXInference: true, modelPath: "kasper-spiritual-v2.0"):
 * - Leverages trained spiritual AI models for personalized guidance
 * - Falls back to templates when AI confidence is low
 * - Combines machine learning with spiritual authenticity validation
 *
 * This configuration approach ensures that users always receive meaningful
 * spiritual guidance regardless of the underlying implementation details.
