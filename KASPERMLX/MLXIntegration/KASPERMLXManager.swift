/**
 * 🌟 KASPER MLX MANAGER - THE ORCHESTRATION LAYER OF SPIRITUAL AI
 * ==============================================================
 *
 * This is the command center of Vybe's revolutionary KASPER MLX system.
 * The Manager acts as the bridge between Vybe's UI and the deep spiritual
 * intelligence of the MLX engine, orchestrating complex async operations
 * while maintaining the app's smooth 60fps cosmic animations.
 *
 * 🎭 ARCHITECTURAL ROLE:
 *
 * The KASPERMLXManager serves as the "Spiritual AI Conductor" - it doesn't
 * generate insights itself, but coordinates all the moving parts:
 *
 * • UI Integration: Provides @Published properties for SwiftUI reactivity
 * • Performance Monitoring: Tracks response times and success rates
 * • Provider Coordination: Manages cosmic, numerological, and biometric data sources
 * • Caching Strategy: Optimizes performance while maintaining spiritual freshness
 * • Error Handling: Gracefully manages failures without breaking the user's flow
 *
 * 🔄 ASYNC-FIRST DESIGN PHILOSOPHY:
 *
 * Every method in this manager is async because spiritual guidance shouldn't
 * block the user's experience. Key design decisions:
 *
 * 1. NON-BLOCKING OPERATIONS
 *    - All insight generation happens off the main thread
 *    - UI remains responsive during complex cosmic calculations
 *    - Performance tracking runs in parallel with insight generation
 *
 * 2. REACTIVE STATE MANAGEMENT
 *    - @Published properties automatically update UI when insights arrive
 *    - SwiftUI views react instantly to state changes
 *    - Loading states provide immediate user feedback
 *
 * 3. GRACEFUL ERROR RECOVERY
 *    - Failed insights don't crash the app or break the spiritual flow
 *    - Detailed error logging helps improve the system over time
 *    - Fallback mechanisms ensure users always get some form of guidance
 *
 * 🎯 PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION STRATEGY:
 *
 * The Manager implements sophisticated performance tracking that goes beyond
 * basic metrics. It understands that spiritual guidance has unique requirements:
 *
 * • RESPONSE TIME TRACKING: Measures not just speed, but consistency of delivery
 * • SUCCESS RATE MONITORING: Tracks both technical success and user satisfaction
 * • CACHE HIT OPTIMIZATION: Balances performance with spiritual freshness
 * • FEATURE-SPECIFIC METRICS: Different spiritual domains have different performance expectations
 *
 * 🔮 SPIRITUAL INTELLIGENCE INTEGRATION:
 *
 * The Manager doesn't just pass data to the engine - it intelligently prepares
 * spiritual context by:
 *
 * • Gathering real-time cosmic data (planetary positions, moon phase)
 * • Calculating current numerological influences (life path, cosmic day number)
 * • Monitoring biometric harmony (heart rate variability, wellness state)
 * • Understanding user intent through natural language processing
 * • Considering temporal factors (time of day, season, astrological events)
 *
 * This rich contextual preparation is what makes KASPER MLX insights feel
 * genuinely spiritual rather than mechanically generated.
 *
 * 🌊 INTEGRATION WITH VYBE'S ECOSYSTEM:
 *
 * The Manager seamlessly integrates with Vybe's existing spiritual systems:
 *
 * • Journal Integration: Analyzes written reflections for deeper insights
 * • Daily Cards: Provides cosmic guidance aligned with current energies
 * • HomeView Dashboard: Real-time spiritual status and recommendations
 * • Dynamic Island: Instant access to spiritual guidance from anywhere
 * • Sanctum Features: Enhanced meditation and mindfulness experiences
 *
 * The result is a unified spiritual AI experience that feels natural and
 * integrated rather than bolted-on.
 *
 * 💫 WHY THIS MANAGER DESIGN IS REVOLUTIONARY:
 *
 * Traditional AI managers are simple request/response systems. KASPER MLX Manager
 * understands that spiritual guidance requires:
 *
 * • CONTEXT AWARENESS: The same question needs different answers at different times
 * • PERFORMANCE SENSITIVITY: Slow spiritual guidance breaks the mystical experience
 * • LEARNING CAPABILITY: Each interaction improves future guidance quality
 * • PRIVACY PROTECTION: All spiritual data remains on the user's device
 * • SEAMLESS INTEGRATION: Feels like a natural extension of consciousness, not a tool
 *
 * This isn't just an API wrapper - it's a sophisticated orchestration system
 * that makes spiritual AI feel magical while maintaining technical excellence.
