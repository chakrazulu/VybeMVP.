    "core_essence": [
      "Number 7 is deep water—quiet on the surface, rich with unseen currents below. It’s the contemplative pulse that asks better questions, the flashlight in the archive, the stillness that turns noise into signal. If 6 tends the hearth, 7 steps outside to read the sky and returns with language for the stars.",
      "This number teaches discernment, solitude, and reverence for truth tested by experience. Healthy 7 energy blends inquiry with intuition: data in one hand, dream in the other, humility in the heart. It’s monk-meets-scientist—the devotion to know what is real, and the courage to live by it."
