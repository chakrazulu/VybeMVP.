    "core_essence": [
      "Number 22 turns vision into durable systems; you build structures that work on Wednesday afternoon, not just in brainstorms.",
      "Your gift is scale with stability; you design for thousands without losing the care of one.",
      "You think in blueprints; start every project with a one‑page plan that names the purpose, people, process, and proof of success.",
      "You blend the intuition of 11 with the execution of 4; sense what wants to exist, then schedule the bricks.",
      "You favor repeatable wins; document the steps the moment something works so others can reproduce it.",
      "You lead quietly through competence; promises are short, delivery is long, and results do the talking.",
      "You respect constraints; you treat limits as design prompts that make solutions stronger, not smaller.",
      "You turn chaos into checklists; when rooms get loud, you anchor the next clear task and the owner.",
      "You choose durability over drama; you would rather ship the infrastructure than the headline.",
      "You optimize for handoff; you build so the work survives you, not so it depends on you.",
      "You keep ethics central; you won’t scale shortcuts that erode trust or burn out people.",
      "You measure what matters; you define two or three metrics that confirm the structure is holding under real load."
    ],
    "daily_practical_guidance": [
      "Start with a 20‑minute systems sweep: check the dashboards, scan for outliers, and line up the day’s top three fixes.",
      "Give every meeting an output artifact: a shared note with decisions, owners, and dates stored in the same place every time.",
      "Block a 90‑minute builder window with notifications off; lay one structural brick that reduces future work for everyone.",
      "Operate a two‑track day: morning for creation, afternoon for coordination; protect the morning like a construction site.",
      "Use a definition‑of‑done checklist for each task so quality is consistent regardless of who finishes it.",
      "Move single‑use tasks into templates; if you did it once, make it a repeatable pattern before the day ends.",
      "Practice the five‑minute fix rule; if a friction is small and recurring, eliminate it immediately rather than adding it to a backlog.",
