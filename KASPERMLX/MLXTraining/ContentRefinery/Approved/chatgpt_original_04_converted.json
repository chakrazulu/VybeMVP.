    "core_essence": [
      "Number 4 is the architecture of reality—plans, pillars, and practiced steps that turn vision into weight‑bearing outcomes. If 1 is the spark, 2 the alignment, and 3 the expression, 4 is the frame that holds when weather hits. This is earth energy: method, craft, and measurable progress. Healthy 4 doesn’t worship rigidity; it builds adaptable systems that are simple, strong, and easy to maintain."

    "daily_practical_guidance": [
      "Begin with a four‑block day plan: One Big Outcome, Two Support Tasks, One Maintenance Task. Put them in that order and work top‑down.",
      "Use “concrete blocks” of 40 minutes on / 10 minutes off for deep build time; schedule exactly four blocks for high‑focus days.",

      "Set a “definition of done” for each task (artifact, test, timestamp); ambiguity is where time leaks out.",

      "Name your workbench—desk, app, notebook—and keep it sacred: no doomscrolling there, only build energy.",
      "Use “constraints as scaffolding”: time cap, budget cap, scope cap. The frame makes the build faster.",
      "End the day with a two‑line log: what you finished, what you’ll start first tomorrow. Leave a tool out as a cue."
