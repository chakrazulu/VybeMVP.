## 🧠 **Behavioral Mining Architecture**

### **Trinity Foundation Structure**
Each trinity combination (e.g., 7-3-1) produces a unique behavioral signature:
- **Life Path 7:** Seeker, contemplative, analytical approach to life
- **Expression 3:** Creative communicator, joyful expression of mission
- **Soul Urge 1:** Independent drive, leadership desires, pioneering spirit

**Result:** A contemplative leader who seeks truth but expresses findings through creative communication while driven by independent pioneering instincts.

### **12 Core Behavioral Categories**
1. **Decision-Making Patterns** - How they process choices and commitments
2. **Stress Response Signatures** - Default reactions under pressure
3. **Communication Styles** - Language patterns, listening habits, conflict approaches
4. **Relationship Dynamics** - Attraction patterns, intimacy expressions, boundary styles
5. **Career Optimization** - Work environments, leadership styles, productivity rhythms
6. **Spiritual Expression** - Connection practices, growth triggers, transcendence paths
7. **Creative Outlets** - Artistic expressions, innovation approaches, aesthetic preferences
8. **Learning Modalities** - Information processing, skill acquisition, teaching styles
9. **Health & Wellness** - Physical needs, emotional regulation, energy patterns
10. **Financial Behaviors** - Money mindset, spending patterns, abundance blocks
11. **Life Transition Navigation** - Change responses, timing sensitivity, adaptation strategies
12. **Shadow Integration** - Unconscious patterns, growth edges, healing pathways
