## 💡 Smart Delivery Strategies

### 1. Layered Time-Based Delivery
```swift
func getInsightForTimeOfDay() -> String {
    let hour = Calendar.current.component(.hour, from: Date())

    switch hour {
    case 5...9:  // Morning
        return getFromOriginal()  // Clear, foundational
    case 10...14: // Midday
        return getFromSimpleMultiplied()  // Variety
    case 15...19: // Afternoon
        return getFromAdvanced()  // Deep work
    case 20...23: // Evening
        return getFromAdvanced(context: "evening_integration")
    default:      // Night
        return getFromOriginal()  // Gentle
    }
}
```

### 2. User Experience Level System
```swift
enum UserLevel {
    case new        // < 7 days: Original
    case regular    // 7-30 days: Simple Multiplied
    case engaged    // 30-90 days: Mix all three
    case power      // > 90 days: Advanced focus
}
```

### 3. Context-Aware Selection
```swift
func getInsightForContext(_ context: UserContext) -> String {
    switch context {
    case .quickNotification:
        return getFromOriginal()  // Short, punchy
    case .dailyInsight:
        return getFromSimpleMultiplied()  // Contextual
    case .deepDive:
        return getFromAdvanced()  // Transformative
    case .widget:
        return getFromOriginal()  // Clean display
    }
}
```

## 🔌 Firebase Integration Points

### Current Integration Check

#### 1. NumberMeaningViewModel Integration
```swift
// ViewModels/NumberMeaningViewModel.swift
// NEEDS UPDATE to handle three-tier system

func loadInsights(for number: Int) async {
    // Current: Only loads original
    // NEEDED: Smart selection from all three tiers

    let tier = determineTierForUser()

    switch tier {
    case .original:
        loadFromFile("NumberMessages_Complete_\(number)")
    case .multiplied:
        loadFromFile("NumberMessages_Complete_\(number)_multiplied")
    case .advanced:
        loadFromFile("NumberMessages_Complete_\(number)_advanced")
    }
}
```

#### 2. Firebase Service Integration
```swift
// Services/FirebaseService.swift
// NEEDS UPDATE for multiple sources

func fetchDailyInsight() async -> String {
    // Smart selection based on:
    // - Time of day
    // - User engagement level
    // - Previous insights shown
    // - Special events (full moon, retrogrades, etc.)

    let insightSource = SmartSelector.selectOptimalSource(
        userProfile: currentUser,
        timeContext: Date(),
        cosmicContext: getCurrentPlanetaryPositions()
    )

    return await insightSource.getInsight()
}
```

#### 3. Widget Provider Integration
```swift
// Widgets/NumberMeaningWidget.swift
// NEEDS UPDATE for widget-appropriate content

func getWidgetInsight() -> String {
    // Prefer original for clean display
    // Fallback to simple multiplied
    // Never use advanced (too long for widgets)
}
```

#### 4. Push Notification Integration
```swift
// Services/NotificationService.swift
// NEEDS UPDATE for notification variety

func scheduleDailyInsight() {
    // Rotate through all three tiers
    // Track which tier was used last
    // Ensure variety in notifications
}
```

---

## 📈 Quality Assurance System

### Automated Quality Checks
```python
# scripts/validate_firebase_insights.py

def validate_all_insights():
    """Ensure quality across all tiers"""

    for file in all_insight_files:
        # Check for:
        # - Duplicate content
        # - Minimum/maximum length
        # - Spiritual authenticity
        # - Grammar and flow
        # - Appropriate tier placement

        quality_score = calculate_quality(file)
        if quality_score < 0.8:
            flag_for_review(file)
```

### A/B Testing Framework
```swift
struct InsightABTest {
    let testName: String
    let variants: [InsightTier]
    let metrics: [String: Any]

    func trackEngagement() {
        // Track:
        // - Read completion
        // - Share rate
        // - Save rate
        // - Return rate
    }
}
