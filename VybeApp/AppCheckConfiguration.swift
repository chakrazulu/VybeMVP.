/*
 * ========================================
 * 🔐 FIREBASE APP CHECK CONFIGURATION
 * ========================================
 * 
 * ENTERPRISE SECURITY SOLUTION:
 * Configures Firebase App Check to enable enterprise-compliant authentication
 * that bypasses Google Cloud organization policy domain restrictions while
 * maintaining security through iOS app attestation.
 * 
 * PHASE 10C-A IMPLEMENTATION:
 * - App Attest provider for production builds
 * - Debug provider for development/simulator testing
 * - Automatic token handling by Firebase SDK
 * - Zero manual credential management
 * 
 * INTEGRATION POINTS:
 * - VybeMVPApp: Initialize during app startup
 * - CosmicService: Automatic token inclusion in HTTP requests
 * - Firebase Functions: App Check token verification
 * 
 * SECURITY BENEFITS:
 * - Prevents unauthorized API usage
 * - Bypasses organization policy restrictions
 * - Enterprise-grade app attestation
 * - Mobile-first authentication

 * CONFIGURATION STRATEGY:
 * - Production: App Attest provider (requires physical device and App Store)
 * - Development: Debug provider (works in Simulator and development builds)
 * - Automatic: Firebase SDK handles token generation and inclusion
 * 
 * ORGANIZATION POLICY SOLUTION:
 * App Check tokens are accepted by Google Cloud even under domain restrictions
 * because they prove the request comes from a legitimate, attested app instance.
