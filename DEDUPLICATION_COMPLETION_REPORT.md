- `deletion_log_emergency_backup.txt`
- `deletion_log_reconstruction_backup.txt`

### ✅ PHASE 2: DIRECTORY CONSOLIDATION (3.1MB Recovered)

**ELIMINATED REDUNDANCY:**
- Deleted `ApprovedInsights/` directory (130 files, 3.1MB)
- Preserved `KASPERMLX/MLXTraining/ContentRefinery/Approved/` as source of truth
- Verified: Files were byte-for-byte identical (only .DS_Store diff)

**Safety Protocol**: `deletion_log_approved_insights.txt` created

### ✅ PHASE 3: QUALITY TIER OPTIMIZATION (~10MB Recovered)

**ELIMINATED BROKEN CONTENT:**
- Deleted 10 `*_advanced.json` files (~6.5MB) - grammatically broken
- Deleted 10 `*_multiplied.json` files (~1.2MB) - repetitive bloat

**PRESERVED A+ CONTENT:**
- 10 Original files (`NumberMessages_Complete_X.json`) - clean, concise ✓
- 10 Archetypal files (`NumberMessages_Complete_X_archetypal.json`) - high quality ✓
- 1 Template file (`personalized_insight_templates.json`) ✓

**Quality Improvement Examples**:
- **REMOVED**: "This morning.s spiritual energy reveals the power of this spiritual essence..."
