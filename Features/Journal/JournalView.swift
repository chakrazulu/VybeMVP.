/**
 * ðŸ“– JOURNALVIEW - SOPHISTICATED SPIRITUAL REFLECTION ECOSYSTEM ðŸ“–
 * 
 * Claude: JournalView represents the heart of Vybe's spiritual reflection system,
 * providing users with a sophisticated digital sanctuary for documenting their
 * cosmic journey. This isn't just a simple note-taking interface - it's a
 * carefully designed spiritual companion that integrates KASPER MLX AI insights,
 * numerological awareness, and cosmic alignment detection to transform personal
 * reflection into profound spiritual growth.
 * 
 * The view demonstrates advanced SwiftUI architecture combining complex filtering
 * systems, real-time search capabilities, and seamless KASPER MLX integration
 * that provides contextually-aware spiritual guidance based on journal content.
 *
 * SPIRITUAL REFLECTION FEATURES:
 * â€¢ Advanced search and filtering system for spiritual journey tracking
 * â€¢ KASPER MLX integration providing AI insights on journal entries
 * â€¢ Sacred number tagging system connecting entries to numerological themes
 * â€¢ Mood and spiritual state tracking with visual indicators
 * â€¢ Seamless navigation between reflection and insight generation
 *
 * PERFORMANCE ARCHITECTURE:
 * â€¢ LazyVStack rendering for smooth scrolling with large journal collections
 * â€¢ Intelligent search debouncing preventing excessive Core Data queries
 * â€¢ Memory-efficient state management with proper Combine integration
 * â€¢ Background processing for AI insight generation without UI blocking
 * 
 * Claude: JournalView - Main spiritual reflection interface for cosmic journey documentation
 * 
 * ðŸŽ¯ PIXEL-PERFECT UI REFERENCE GUIDE FOR FUTURE AI ASSISTANTS ðŸŽ¯
 * 
 * === CORE PURPOSE ===
 * Primary journaling interface where users document their spiritual journey.
 * Combines personal reflection with numerological tracking and cosmic insights.
 * 
 * === SCREEN LAYOUT (iPhone 14 Pro Max: 430Ã—932 points) ===

 * 
 * === SHEET PRESENTATIONS ===
 * â€¢ New Entry: NewJournalEntryView modal
 * â€¢ Entry Detail: NavigationLink to JournalEntryDetailView
 * 
 * === FILTERING LOGIC ===
 * 1. Start with all journalManager.entries
 * 2. Apply focus number filter if selected
 * 3. Apply mood filter if selected
 * 4. Apply search text filter (case insensitive)
 * 5. Return filtered array
 * 
 * === DATA REFRESH ===
 * â€¢ onAppear: Calls journalManager.loadEntries()
 * â€¢ Ensures fresh data when view appears
 * â€¢ Handles Core Data updates automatically
 * 
 * === DELETION HANDLING ===
 * â€¢ Swipe gesture: iOS standard delete behavior
 * â€¢ Calls: journalManager.deleteEntry() for each
 * â€¢ Immediate UI update via environment object
 * 
 * === SEARCH FUNCTIONALITY ===
 * â€¢ Prompt: "Search journals..."
 * â€¢ Searches: Entry title and content fields
 * â€¢ Case insensitive matching
 * â€¢ Real-time filtering as user types
 * 
 * === CRITICAL NOTES ===
 * â€¢ Clear backgrounds show cosmic animation
 * â€¢ All filtering is non-destructive
 * â€¢ Multiple filter types are exclusive
 * â€¢ Environment object ensures data consistency
