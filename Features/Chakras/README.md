# Phantom of the Chakras

## Overview

The Phantom of the Chakras is an interactive spiritual feature that allows users to explore and harmonize their seven chakras through sound, vibration, and visual feedback. Each chakra is represented by a beautiful, animated symbol that responds to touch and resonates with the user's numerological profile.

## Features

1. **Interactive Chakra Display**
   - Seven vertically aligned chakra symbols
   - Each chakra has unique colors, frequencies, and properties
   - Animated glow effects that respond to user interaction

2. **Multi-Sensory Interaction**
   - **Tap**: Quick activation with visual and haptic feedback
   - **Long Press**: Continuous harmonization with sustained tones
   - **Multi-Touch**: Play multiple chakras simultaneously for harmonic blends

3. **Numerological Integration**
   - Chakras automatically resonate with user's Focus Number
   - Enhanced glow for chakras aligned with Realm Number
   - Visual indication of spiritual alignment

4. **Meditation Mode**
   - Dedicated meditation interface with Om symbol
   - Timer with progress tracking
   - Play/pause/stop controls
   - 5-minute default sessions (configurable)

     - Sanskrit names
     - Colors (traditional chakra colors)
     - Frequencies (Solfeggio healing frequencies)
     - Elements, mantras, and affirmations
     - Numerological associations

2. **ChakraManager (Singleton)**
   - AVAudioEngine for tone generation
   - CoreHaptics for vibrational feedback
   - State management for all chakras
   - Meditation timer functionality

3. **Audio System**
   - Pure sine wave generation for each frequency
   - Real-time audio synthesis
   - Multi-channel mixing for simultaneous playback
   - Volume control

4. **Haptic System**
   - Frequency-based haptic patterns
   - Synchronized with audio playback
   - Adjustable intensity

## Chakra Properties

| Chakra | Sanskrit | Frequency | Element | Number Resonance |
|--------|----------|-----------|---------|------------------|
| Root | Muladhara | 396 Hz | Earth | 1, 4, 8 |
| Sacral | Svadhisthana | 417 Hz | Water | 2, 6 |
| Solar Plexus | Manipura | 528 Hz | Fire | 3, 9 |

## User Experience

### Visual Design
- Cosmic background integration
- Glowing aura effects with multiple layers
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Sanskrit names displayed on symbols
- Active state indicators

### Interaction Flow
1. User enters Chakras tab
2. Chakras animate in from bottom to top
3. Tap for detail sheet with full information
4. Long press to activate continuous tone
5. "Begin Meditation" opens dedicated meditation view

## Configuration

The `ChakraConfiguration` struct allows customization of:
- Sound enabled/disabled
- Haptics enabled/disabled
- Visual effects toggle
- Volume level (0.0 - 1.0)
- Meditation duration

## Future Enhancements

1. **Chakra Journal Integration**
   - Log chakra states during meditation
   - Track balance over time

2. **Guided Chakra Meditation**
   - Audio guidance for each chakra
   - Progressive activation sequences

3. **Chakra Analytics**
   - Track which chakras are most/least active
   - Personalized balance recommendations

4. **Advanced Visualizations**
   - Sacred geometry overlays
   - Energy flow animations
   - Aura visualization

## Integration Notes

- The feature integrates seamlessly with existing numerology systems
- Uses the shared `CosmicBackgroundView` for visual consistency
- Follows MVVM architecture pattern
- All audio/haptic resources are generated programmatically (no external files needed)

## Performance Considerations

- Audio engine starts on-demand to save battery
- Haptic patterns are pre-calculated for efficiency
- Animations use SwiftUI's built-in optimization
- Memory-efficient tone generation

## Testing

To test the feature:
1. Add files to Xcode project (see add_chakras_to_xcode.sh)
2. Build and run
3. Navigate to the Chakras tab
4. Test each interaction mode
5. Verify audio plays through device speakers
6. Check haptic feedback on supported devices
