## 🌙 Core Intelligence Features to Build

### 1. **Retrograde Intelligence System** 🔄
**Target:** `NumerologyData/FirebaseRetrogradeInfluence/`

**Context Modulation with Voice Softening:**
- **Direct Motion:** Outward action, forward momentum, external focus

**Enhanced Tone Transformation Examples:**
- Direct: *"Mercury calls you to speak with clarity today—words as arrows, setting direction with every choice you voice aloud."*
- Retrograde: *"Mercury in retrograde does not demand your voice—it invites you to pause, notice what was left unsaid, and refine the message before release."*

**Transformation Patterns:**
- **Action → Reflection:** "act boldly" becomes "pause, then consider acting"
- **External → Internal:** "in the world" becomes "within your inner landscape"
