# üß† VybeMVP Memory Leak Detection & Performance Profiling
# Automates xctrace (modern Instruments) memory profiling for leak detection and performance analysis
# 
# DEVICE TARGETING OPTIONS:
# - Physical Device (Wireless): Set DEVICE to your actual device name like "iPhone 14 Pro Max"
# - Simulator: Set DEVICE to "iPhone 16 Pro Max" (only simulator installed)
# 
# REQUIREMENTS FOR PHYSICAL DEVICE:
# - Device on same WiFi as Mac (for wireless profiling)
# - OR device plugged in via USB cable
# - Developer mode enabled on device
# - Device trusted/paired with Xcode
# 
# FUTURE AI CONTEXT:
# - This script was enhanced during Performance Optimization Sprint (Post-Phase 18)
# - Targets user's personal iPhone 14 Pro Max for real-world performance data
# - Can fallback to iPhone 16 Pro Max simulator if device unavailable
# - Creates timestamped .trace files for comparison across optimization iterations
